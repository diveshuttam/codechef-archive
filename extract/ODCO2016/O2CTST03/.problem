He can just sit down and order his assistant \"0 X\" to pour 1 L of water<br />\nto bucket numbered X(0 indexing) or \"1 x\" meaning to take all the water out of the X'th bucket and pour it into the giant bucket.<br />\nAfter he has made all the orders,he wants to know the amount of water remaining in the giant bucket.<br />\nHis assistant was taking a lot of time to provide him with the answer so he asks for your help.</p>\n<p><b>The initial amount of water in all the buckets is 0.</b></p>\n<p>Each query or order will be of the form \"P<sub>i</sub> Q<sub>i</sub>\", where P<sub>i</sub> is either 0 or 1 which denotes the type of query and Q<sub>i</sub> is the index of the bucket on which the operation needs to take place, where </p>\n<pre>\nP<sub>0</sub> = 0\nP<sub>i</sub> = ! P<sub>i-1</sub> (where '!' denotes LOGICAL NOT)\nQ<sub>0</sub> = X\nQ<sub>i</sub> = ( Q<sub>i-1</sub> * A + B ) % 10^9 ('%' denotes MODULO operation)\n\nYou will be given the values of X, A and B. You need to generate the queries by using the above formulae.\n</pre><h3>Input</h3>\n<p>First Line of the test case contains Q,the total no of queries he is going to ask.<br />\nThe next line will contain three integers A, B and X.\n</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>After all the queries are generated and processed,output a single line containing the quantity of water in the giant bucket.</p>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<p>1 &lt;= Q &lt;= 10^7</p>\n<p>0 &lt;= A,B,X &lt;= 10^9</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n4\n1 0 123\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n2\n</pre><p>\u00a0</p>\n",
