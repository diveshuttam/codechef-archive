Recently, his club has organized an inter-college competition, which was a grand success. However, when the competition ended, Ratnadeep realized that he has to clean up all the mess created as a result of the event, and the rest of the members of the club have already left for home. The mess was mainly created because of empty cardboard boxes which once contained the equipments required for the event.</p>\n<p>The cardboard boxes are of cubical shape and are of various sizes. All he has to do is pack one cardboard box inside another, pack the resulting box into another empty box and so on. Also since there is a shortage of space in the club room, he has to pack the boxes in such a way that he finally ends up with the minimum number of packed cardboard boxes possible. Note that a cardboard box can be packed inside another cardboard box only if its size (ie. Length of an edge) is strictly smaller than the second one and only one box (empty or packed) can be packed inside another box.</p>\n<p>At the moment, he is feeling very exhausted, but being the president of the club he cannot run away from his responsibilities. So he needs your help. You will be provided with the sizes of the various cardboard boxes (which is nothing but an integer denoting the length of an edge of the cube). You have to calculate the minimum number of boxes into which Ratnadeep can pack all the boxes.</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The first line consists of T denoting the number of test cases. T test cases follow. The first line of each test case consists of an integer N, denoting the number of cardboard boxes. The next line contains N integers \u2013 A1, A2, ... , An \u2013 denoting the sizes of the cardboard boxes.</p>\n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>For each test case output with a single line, the minimum number of cardboard boxes into which all the boxes can be packed.</p>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<p>1&lt;=T&lt;=25</p>\n<p>1&lt;=N&lt;=10^5</p>\n<p>1&lt;=A[i]&lt;=10^9</p>\n<p>Sum of N over all test cases &lt;= 10^6 </p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<p><b>Input:</b></p>\n<p>2</p>\n<p>5</p>\n<p>5 6 8 9 2</p>\n<p>7</p>\n<p>1 9 5 2 5 1 6</p>\n<p><b>Output:</b></p>\n<p>1</p>\n<p>2</p>\n\n<h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p>In example case 1, Ratnadeep can pack the boxes as follows: </p>\n<p>Box of size 2 is packed inside box of size 5. This box is then packed inside the box of size 6, which is then packed inside box of size 8 and then packed into the largest one(ie. of size 9)</p>\n",
