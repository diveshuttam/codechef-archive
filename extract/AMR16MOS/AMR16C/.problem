    "body": "<p>Recently social media has been flooded by fb posts, tweets, news articles about only thing - demonetization. A great debate is ongoing over it. Most of the people discussing in social media platform usually tend to take sides, i.e. either they support the move, or they not.</p>\n\n<p>There is such a group of <b>N</b> people, who vehemently discuss about their views about this everywhere possible on any platform. The influence of a person is determined by the number of posts he makes. The more posts you make about your support/opposition, more your influence. Usually it is hard to determine whether a person supports/opposes the moves just by reading their posts, as they will make some oblique references here and there, often followed by a big digression into cat-dog memes, and name calling as the final resort, sometimes as a first resort too in rare cases. But you came to know from FB AI team that the people whose support this move behave slightly oddly. Specifically, FB team told that a person will be a supporter if number of divisors of the number of posts a person makes is an odd prime number.</p>\n\n<p>You are given information about number of posts each person makes, specifically person <b>i</b> makes <b>P<sub>i</sub></b> posts. A study about user behavior tells that no-one likes to have same number of posts as the other persons as they consider it as a loss of their identity. So, users make posts in such a way that no two persons have the same number of posts, i.e., all the <b>P<sub>i</sub></b>'s  are distinct. You want to study the social media strength of users supporting the move. Let <b>K</b> denote the number of supporters of the move. For each <b>i</b>-th most influential supporter, you want to find his/her rank in overall influence in the social media (considering both supporters/opposers).</b>\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The first line contains an integer <b>T</b> denoting the number of test cases. <b>T</b> test cases follow.</p>\n<p>The first line of each test case contains a single integer <b>N</b> denoting the number of people in the group on social media.</p>\n<p>The second line of each test case contains <b>N</b> space separated integers <b>P<sub>i</sub></b> denoting the number of posts made by <b>i</b>-th person.</p>\n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>For each test case, output a single line containing <b>K</b> space separated integers, where <b>i</b>-th of them denotes the overall influence rank of <b>i</b>-th most influential supporter. If <b>K</b> is zero, output \"No supporter found.\" (without quotes) instead.</p>\n\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>T</b> \u2264 <b>10<sup>5</sup></b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>N</b> \u2264 <b>10<sup>5</sup></b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>P<sub>i</sub></b> \u2264 <b>10<sup>12</sup></b></li>\n<li>Sum of <b>N</b> over all test case \u2264 <b>10<sup>5</sup></b></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n2\n2\n1 3\n2\n13 9\n\n<b>Output:</b>\nNo supporter found.\n2\n</pre>\n\n<h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p><b>Example case 1</b>. There are two persons on the social media group. You can see that first person has made 1 post. As, number of divisors of <b>1</b> are 1, which is odd but not a prime, so first person is a opposer of demonetization move. Second person is also opposer of the move, as number of divisors of 3 are 2 (1 and 3), which is even.</p>\n<p>As there is no supporter, so the output should be  \"No supporter found.\".</p>\n\n<p><b>Example case 2</b>. Number of divisors of 13 are 2, which are even. So, person 1 is a opposer of the move. Number of divisors of 9 are 1, 3, 9, which is 3. As 3 is an odd and prime number, person 2 is a supporter of the move. Now, we want to find the overall influence ranking of person 2. We see that person 1 has higher number of posts than person 2. So, influence rank of person 2 will be 2.</p>",
