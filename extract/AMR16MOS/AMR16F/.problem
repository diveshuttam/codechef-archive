    "body": "<p>Suryansh, a nanophysics enthusiast, is studying about the GPS Chips present in the\nnewly released Rs. 2000 note. After careful analysis, he has come to know that the GPS\nchips contain nanoparticles! In fact, there are 2 types of GPS Chips:</p>\n\n<p><b>1. Square Shaped</b>:\nThese chips contain <b>square-shaped</b> nanoparticles. A square-shaped GPS Chip of size Z x Z contains Z<sup>2</sup> nanoparticles. See figure 1 for a 4 X 4 sized square shaped chip.</p>\n\n<p><b>2. Hexagonal Beehive Shaped</b>:\nThese chips contain <b>hexagon-shaped</b> nanoparticles arranged like a beehive.\nFrom nanoscopic analysis information, we know that the chip is divided into levels with <b>a hole in the middle</b>.\nThe size of chip is defined as the number of layers it possesses where <b>1<sup>st</sup></b> level contains <b>6</b> nanoparticles, <b>2<sup>nd</sup></b> level contains <b>12</b> nanoparticles, ... , and so on.\nHence, a chip of size 1 has <b>6</b> nanoparticles, a chip of size 2 has <b>18</b>\nnanoparticles (See Figure 2 for clarity), and so on.\n\n<p>Suryansh wishes to create his own Rs. 2000 note for experimental purposes, for which he needs to buy GPS Chips. From the popular Netcoin Shopping Website, he comes to know that for <b>Z Netcoins</b> he can either\npurchase a square-shaped chip of size <b>Z x Z</b> <i>or</i> a hexagon-shaped chip of size <b>Z</b>. For example, with <b>2 Netcoins</b>, he can either buy square-shaped chip containing <b>4</b> nanoparticles <i>or</i> hexagon-shaped chip containing <b>18</b> nanoparticles.</p>\n<p>Suryansh currently has <b>N Netcoins</b> which he wants to spend <b>entirely</b>. He needs to purchase exactly <b>A</b> square-shaped chips and <b>B</b> hexagon-shaped chips using his entire amout of N Netcoins. He wants to create this new note using all of these <b>A + B</b> GPS Chips.</p>\n\n\n<p><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/codechef_shared/download/upload/amr01.jpg\" height=\"250\"/></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/codechef_shared/download/upload/amr02.jpg\" height=\"250\"/></p>\n\n<p>Suryansh denoted the number of nanoparticles in the i<sup>th</sup> chip that he bought as <b>p<sub>i</sub></b>. He knew that if he decides to buy chips such that they have <b>p<sub>1</sub>, p<sub>2</sub>, ..., p<sub>A+B</sub></b> nanoparticles respectively, his new note will have signal level of: <b>p<sub>1</sub> * p<sub>2</sub> * p<sub>3</sub> * ... * p<sub>A+B</sub></b>\nHe calls this the sequence <b>p<sub>1</sub>, p<sub>2</sub>, ..., p<sub>A+B</sub></b> a <b>configuration</b>.</p>\n\n<p>Help him find <b>sum</b> of signal levels of all possible configurations modulo <b>1234567891</b>.\nTwo configurations are different if any of the <b>p<sub>i</sub></b> is different.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>\nFirst line contains a single integer <b>T</b> - the number of testcases.<br/>\nT testcases follow which have the following format:<br/>\nA single line of input contains 3 space-separated integers <b>A</b>, <b>B</b> and <b>N</b>, denoting the number of square-shaped chips, number of hexagonal beehive shaped chips and number of netcoins.</p>\n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>For each testcase, print the sum of signal levels of all possible configurations modulo <b>1234567891</b>.</p>\n\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b>1 \u2264 T \u2264 10</b></li>\n<li><b>1 \u2264 A, B \u2264 10<sup>5</sup></b></li>\n<li><b>1 \u2264 N \u2264 10<sup>9</sup></b></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Sample Input</h3>\n<b>Input:</b><pre>2\n1 1 3\n2 1 4\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n42\n66\n</pre>\n\n<h3>Explanation:</h3>\n\n<p><b>Testcase 1:</b></p>\n<p><b>A</b> = 1, <b>B</b> = 1, <b>N</b> = 3.</p>\n<p>Since <b>N</b> Netcoins have to be spent entirely, the only 2 ways in which\nchips can be bought are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>1 square-shaped chip of size 2x2 and 1 hexagon-shaped chip of size 1 are bought.\np<sub>1</sub> = 4, p<sub>2</sub> = 6.
