The first shop is described by a string \"111110\", which means that ingredients 1 through 5 are available in this shop, but ingredient 6 isn't. The other two shops are described by strings \"110011\" and \"001111\" respectively. Any two shops are enough to get all 6 ingredients (because, for every two shops it's true that each of 6 ingredients is available in at least one of those two shops).</p>\n\n<p>To minimize the total distance, Limak should visit the first and the second shop (in any order). For example, his journey can look as follows:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Go from the starting point (0, 0) to the first shop (100, 100). The distance is sqrt(100<sup>2</sup> + 100<sup>2</sup>) = 141.4213562373095.</li>\n<li>Go from (100, 100) to (-50, 100). The distance is 150.</li>\n<li>Go from (-50, 100) back to the kitchen at (0, 0). The distance is sqrt(50<sup>2</sup> + 100<sup>2</sup>) = 111.80339887498948</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The total distance is 141.4213562373095 + 150 + 111.80339887498948 = 403.224755112299.</p>\n\n<p><b>Test case 2.</b> This time the third shop has all the ingredients. It's optimal to visit only this shop and go back to the kitchen.</p>\n\n<p><b>Test case 4.</b> Limak can't get all ingredients, even if he visits all the shops. The answer is -1.</p>",
