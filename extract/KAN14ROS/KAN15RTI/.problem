He was delighted to see that a small child was showing interest in the beautiful<br />\nworld of binary strings. To further interest the child and to make sure that the child keeps on<br />\nplaying with binary strings, he gave the child a task:</p>\n<p>Each day the child has to now play with the binary string that comes lexicographically after<br />\nthe string that he was playing with on the previous day.</p>\n<p>He promised the child that whenever he visits back, he will ask him the string that he should<br />\nbe playing with. If the child gets the correct string, he will recieve a reward from Da Vinci, and<br />\nmay be Da Vinci will take him as his student.</p>\n<p>Help the child to find what string he should be playing with on the day Da Vinci visits him back.</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>First line contains T, the number of testcases. It is followed by 2T lines, 2 lines per testcase.\n</li><li>First line of each testcase starts with a binary string L. Second line contains a single integer K, number of days after which Da Vinci visits the child. The binary string has no leading zeroes, e.g., 0111 has a 0 in the leading (first) position, and such strings will not be there in the input.\n</li></ul>\n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>For each testcase, output one line containing the required answer. The output string should not have leading zeroes.\n</li></ul>\n\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>1 \u2264 T \u2264 1000\n</li><li>1 \u2264 N \u2264 1000\n</li><li>1 \u2264 K \u2264 10<sup>18</sup>\n</li></ul>\n\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n2\n1001\n1\n1000\n3\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n1010\n1011\n</pre>\n",
