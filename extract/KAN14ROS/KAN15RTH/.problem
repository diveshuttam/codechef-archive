In preparation of that, Da Vinci has painted a total of N paintings that he would display to the King.<br />\nSince, the King is very busy dealing with the after effects of war, he has asked Da Vinci to make<br />\nsure that he can see all of his paintings in one standing. To solve that problem, Da Vinci has<br />\ndone the following:</p>\n<p>He has manufactured N tables, each one of a different height. He plans to keep tables in a<br />\nrow and display a painting at the top of each table. This way, the King will be able to see all<br />\nthe paintings when he is standing in front of this row of tables. All the paintings are of equal<br />\nheight.</p>\n<p>This plan of Da Vinci was perfect but he received the news of another rebellion in Florence.<br />\nHe knows that since King has promised to see Da Vinci\u2019s work, he won\u2019t back down. Da Vinci<br />\ndoes not want to hold the King for too long and now has decided that he will only show K of<br />\nhis paintings to the King. For that, he will re-arrange the tables so that the King can only see<br />\nK of his paintings when he is standing at the front of the row. King can see a painting if there<br />\nis no painting in front of it in the row, which is blocking King\u2019s view. Da Vinci will not remove<br />\nany tables, because if King decides that he wants to look at more of Da Vinci\u2019s work, he wants<br />\nto be able to show it without adding anymore delay.</p>\n<p>All of Da Vinci\u2019s paintings are the best in the world, so he knows he can choose any of his<br />\nK paintings to display to the King. Help Da Vinci in finding in how many ways he can arrange<br />\nthe table so that only K of his paintings are visible to the King.</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The first line of the input contains an integer T which is the number of test cases to follow.<br />\nThen T lines follow, each containing two space separated integers N and K.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>For each of the test cases, print the total number of ways Da Vinci can make them sit in a row.<br />\nSince this number can be very large, output it modulo 1000000007.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<p>Should contain all the constraints on the input data that you may have. Format it like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>T</b> \u2264 <b>501501</b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>N</b> \u2264 <b>1000</b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>K</b> \u2264 <b>1000</b></li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n3\n2 1\n2 2\n4 2\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n1\n1\n11\n</pre><p>\u00a0</p>\n",
