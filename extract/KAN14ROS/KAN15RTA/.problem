He would like one of his three sons to take up his place<br />\nas the next King. But he doesn\u2019t want them to fight over the throne after his death. Over so<br />\nmany years in the past, his sons have been fighting with each other over trifles. But he feels<br />\nthat deep inside their hearts, the three brothers love each other. The King believes that he can<br />\nbring back the love and harmony among his sons which was present in their childhood. He has<br />\nasked Leonardo to help him accomplish this task so that his sons cherish their relationship<br />\nagain. So, Leonardo has come up with a game that will force all three of them to play together.</p>\n<p>The factory, just on the boundary of the kingdom, produces special kind of gold chips. Each<br />\ngold chip is inscribed with a lowercase letter of the English alphabet, called its nameLetter.<br />\nThere is also a unique integer called aurumNumber associated with each gold chip which is<br />\ninscribed on the other side of the gold chip. These chips also have special grooves on their ends<br />\nwhich can be used to attach gold chips one after the other and make a long solid linear chain<br />\nout of them.</p>\n<p>On Leonardo\u2019s advice the King has decided to call all his 3 sons for a small collective exer<br />\ncise. Leonardo has made three chains A, B and C containing the same number of gold chips.<br />\nThe gold chips in each of these chains are arranged in the increasing order of their aurumNum<br />\nbers. Leonardo gives a chain to each of the sons. The task given to the sons is that each of<br />\nthem has to create a chain, for which he may remove some of the gold chips from his chain. It<br />\nis necessary that all the three new chains thus created must have the same nameLetters when<br />\nread from left to right. All the removed gold chips will be donated for charity. Each new gold<br />\nchain must also have the gold chips arranged in the increasing order of their aurumNumber. If<br />\nthe sons succeed in doing this, they get to keep the gold chain with themselves. They must<br />\ndonate the entire chain with all of the gold chips for charity if they fail to create such chains.</p>\n<p>All of the three sons are very greedy and therefore they want to remove the minimum number<br />\nof gold chips from their respective gold chains. You have to find out that what is the minimum<br />\nnumber of total gold chips that the three sons have to donate in order to complete this exercise<br />\nsuccessfully.</p>\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The first line of the input contains an integer T which is the number of test cases to follow.<br />\nStarting from the next line, each test case consists of three strings A, B and C in separate lines.<br />\nEach of these strings is the sequence of nameLetters in the order of the gold chips (which are<br />\narranged in the increasing order of their aurumNumber) in the gold chain.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>For each of the test cases, print the minimum number of total gold chips which the three sons<br />\nwill have to donate for charity.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>T</b> \u2264 <b>13</b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>|A|, |B|, |C|</b> \u2264 <b>450</b></li>\n<li><b>|A| = |B| = |C|</b></li>\n<li>Here, |A| denotes the length of a string A. Similarly |B| for B and |C| for C.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Sample</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n2\nacmicpc\nacmicpd\nacdicpc\naab\naba\nabb\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n6\n3\n</pre><p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p><b>Case 1: </b>The gold chips donated by the first son are \u2018m\u2019 and \u2018c\u2019. The second son donates \u2018m\u2019 and \u2018d\u2019 and the third son donates \u2018d\u2019 and \u2018c\u2019. This leaves \u201cacicp\u201d as the nameLetters on the gold chains they create</p>\n<p><b>Case 2: </b>The gold chips donated by the sons are \u2018a\u2019, \u2018a\u2019 and \u2018b\u2019, respectively. This leaves each of them with \u201cab\u201d.</p>\n",
