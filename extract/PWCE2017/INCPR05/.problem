If a player is at a cell indexed i, then in the next\nstep, the player moves forward by a<sub>i</sub> cells, ie the new position of the player will now be i +\na<sub>i</sub>. Each player can start at any cell they want. </br></br>\nThe player who reaches position N first will win.</br></br>\nAlice always plays first. Bob wants to win the game and thus he wants to start at a cell\nsuch that he will win the game. If Alice starts at a cell indexed x, then Bob wants to find out\nthe number of cells from where he can start, such that he will win. Let\u2019s say this number is\nb<sub>x</sub>.</br></br>\nBut Bob does not know Alice\u2019s initial position, so he wants to find the number of winning\npositions for all possible starting positions for Alice.</br></br>\nFind b<sub>x</sub> for every possible values of x from 1 to N.</br></br>\nNote that players can start at any cell indexed 1 to N inclusive</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>First line contains the integer N.</p>\n<p>Second line contains N spaced integers, a<sub>i</sub>.</p>\n\n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>Print N spaced integers, b<sub>i</sub>, i.e the number of winning positions for Bob if Alice starts at\nindex i.</p>\n\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b>1 \u2264 N \u2264 10^5</b></li>\n<li><b>1 \u2264 a<sub>i</sub> \u2264 10^5</b></li>\n<li><b>(i+a<sub>i</sub>) \u2264 N for all 1 \u2264 i \u2264 N</b></li>\n\n</ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n4\n2 2 1 0\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n3 1 1 0\n</pre>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p> If Alice starts from the 1st cell, she would take 2 moves to reach the 4th square. Therefore, Bob has to start from a cell which would take him to 4 in less than 2 moves. There are 3 such cells (2nd, 3rd and 4th), hence the answer. Similar method can be used for other starting positions of Alice.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Authored By: Aditya Sarode</h3>",
