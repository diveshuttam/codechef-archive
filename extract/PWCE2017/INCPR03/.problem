It recently hired <b>N</b> employees to work on a big project. The hiring days <b>H<sub>i</sub></b> of the <b>N</b> employees may be different. The company, while hiring, stated in their T&Cs that the difference between consecutive off days will be <b>D<sub>i</sub></b>. The employees start working from the next day of hiring. In other words, consider the hiring day as the first holiday of that employee. Initially, the company assigned the working period for each employee randomly, but soon observed that when two or more employees have a common day off, they'd spend the whole day partying, which would exhaust them and hence would affect their work. Therefore, the company decided to reschedule the working period for each employee such that for every 2 employee, having working period <b>D<sub>i</sub></b> and <b>D<sub>j</sub></b>, the difference between their consecutive common off days is <b>D<sub>i</sub>*D<sub>j</sub></b>. The <b>D<sub>i</sub></b> of all employees are distinct. The employees are extremely tired and bored of this new schedule, and want to organise a party on a day such that every employee has the day off. As they are too busy with their work but want to party as soon as possible, help them find the closest day for the party.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The first line of the input contains an integer <b>T</b> denoting the number of test cases. The description of <b>T</b> test cases follows.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The first line of each test case contains a single integer <b>N</b></li>\n<li>The next <b>N</b> lines contain two integers <b>H<sub>i</sub></b> and <b>D<sub>i</sub></b>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>For each test case, output a single line corresponding to the closest date for party.</p>\n<p><b>Note: </b> It is guaranteed that the answer won't overflow.</p>\n\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>T</b> \u2264 <b>20</b></li>\n<li><b>2</b> \u2264 <b>N</b> \u2264 <b>10</b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>D<sub>i</sub></b> \u2264 <b>100</b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>H<sub>i</sub></b> \u2264 <b>100</b></li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n1\n2\n14 3\n3 4\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n23\n</pre>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p>The first employee has off on days {14,17,20,23...}. The second employee has off on days {3,7,11,15,19,23...}. Thus, the closest day for party is the 23rd day. </p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Authored By: Rahul Sangvikar</h3>",
