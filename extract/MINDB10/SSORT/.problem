    "body": "<p>Your younger brother has an assignment and needs some help. His teacher gave him a sequence of numbers to be sorted in ascending order. During the sorting process, the places of two numbers can be interchanged. Each interchange has a cost, which is the sum of the two numbers involved.\n<p>You must write a program that determines the minimal cost to sort the sequence of numbers.</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The input file contains several test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains a single integer n (n>1), representing the number of items to be sorted. The second line contains n different integers (each positive and less than 1000), which are the numbers to be sorted.\n<p>The input is terminated by a zero on a line by itself.</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>For each test case, the output is a single line containing the test case number and the minimal cost of sorting the numbers in the test case. \n<p>Place a blank line after the output of each test case.</p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n3\n3 2 1\n4\n8 1 2 4\n5\n1 8 9 7 6\n6\n8 4 5 3 2 7\n0\n\n<b>Output:</b>\nCase 1: 4\n\nCase 2: 17\n\nCase 3: 41\n\nCase 4: 34\n\n</pre>\n",
