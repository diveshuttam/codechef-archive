    "body": "<p>At time 0, <strong>R</strong> red frogs and <strong>G</strong> green frogs are sitting on a straight line. Every frog can be described with an integer number <strong>P</strong>, denoting its initial position and a non negative integer <strong>V</strong>, denoting its velocity.</p>\n<p>Every second, a green frog jumps from its position to its left and a red frog jumps to its right. So if the initial position of a green frog is <strong>0</strong> and its velocity is <strong>5</strong>, then after <strong>1</strong> second, its position will be <strong>-5</strong>. If the color of the frog was red, then its position would be <strong>5</strong>. It takes negligible time for any frog to jump from its current position to the new position. Frogs are only visible on the line at any full second.</p>\n<p>You are also given a segment <strong>[A, B]</strong> where <strong>A</strong> and <strong>B</strong> are two integer numbers and <strong>-10<sup>12</sup> \u2264 A \u2264 B \u2264 10<sup>12</sup></strong>. Please find the maximum possible number of frogs within the interesting segment at any nonnegative integer second since time <strong>0</strong> (including 0).</p>\n<p><strong>Input<br />\n</strong>Input starts with a single positive integer, <strong>T</strong><strong>(1 \u2264 T \u2264 10<sup>6</sup>)</strong>, on a single line, denoting the number of test cases.
