In how many ways, can I choose <b>K</b> elements from the class to sit down, if I see them as being distinct?\" </p>\n<p>Lira replied immediately with the right answer, so, the teacher decided to make the game a little funnier: \"Okay Lira, as you are so fast, now I want you to tell me exactly the same thing, but, with the addition that the value of <b>K</b> is changing, this is, I want you to tell me the sum of the number of ways I can sit down <b>K</b> of you, if the value of <b>K</b> goes from 1 (meaning that there are no chairs in the classroom but one) to N (meaning that all of your chairs arrived). Can you be as fast now? As the answer might get large I want you to tell me the result modulo 1000000007. (10<sup>9</sup> + 7)\"</p>\n<p>As you might have noticed, it's time for you to help Lira solving this variant of the problem. :D </p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The first line of the input file contains an integer <b>T</b>, denoting the number of test cases on the input file.</p>\n<p>Afterwards, <b>T</b> lines follow, each containing an integer <b>N</b>, the number of students that the teacher will try to sit down as the number of chairs goes from 1 to N.</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>For each test case, you should output an integer, denoting the sum of the number of ways the teacher can make <b>N</b> students sit down on <b>K</b> chairs, as <b>K</b> goes from 1 to N, modulo 10<sup>9</sup> + 7.</p>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>T</b> \u2264 <b>100</b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>N</b> \u2264 <b>100000000</b></li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n2\n1\n2\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n1\n3\n</pre><p>\u00a0</p>\n",
