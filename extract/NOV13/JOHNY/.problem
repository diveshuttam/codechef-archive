He lives in Sam's Town. A few days ago he had a birthday, so his parents gave him a gift: MP3-player! Vlad was the happiest man in the world! Now he can listen his favorite songs whenever he wants!</p>\n<p>Vlad built up his own playlist. The playlist consists of <b>N</b> songs, each has a <b>unique</b> positive integer length. Vlad likes all the songs from his playlist, but there is a song, which he likes more than the others. It's named \"Uncle Johny\".</p>\n<p>After creation of the playlist, Vlad decided to sort the songs in increasing order of their lengths. For example, if the lengths of the songs in playlist was {1, 3, 5, 2, 4} after sorting it becomes {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. Before the sorting, \"Uncle Johny\" was on <b>K</b>-th position (1-indexing is assumed for the playlist) in the playlist.</p>\n<p>Vlad needs your help! He gives you all the information of his playlist. Your task is to find the position of \"Uncle Johny\" in  the sorted playlist.</p>\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\nThe first line of the input contains an integer <b>T</b> denoting the number of test cases. The description of <b>T</b> test cases follows. \n<p> </p> \nThe first line of each test case contains one integer <b>N</b> denoting the number of songs in Vlad's playlist. The second line contains <b>N</b> space-separated integers <b>A<sub>1</sub></b>, <b>A<sub>2</sub></b>, ..., <b>A<sub>N</sub></b> denoting the lenghts of Vlad's songs.\nThe third line contains the only integer <b>K</b> - the position of \"Uncle Johny\" in the initial playlist.\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3>Output</h3>\nFor each test case, output a single line containing the position of \"Uncle Johny\" in the sorted playlist.\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n1 \u2264 <b>T</b> \u2264 1000\n<p> </p>\n1 \u2264 <b>K</b> \u2264 <b>N</b> \u2264 100\n<p> </p>\n1 \u2264 <b>A<sub>i</sub></b> \u2264 10<sup>9</sup>\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n3\n4\n1 3 4 2\n2\n5\n1 2 3 9 4\n5\n5\n1 2 3 9 4 \n1\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n3\n4\n1\n</pre>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Explanation</h3>\n\n<p>In the example test there are <b>T</b>=3 test cases.</p>\n\n<p><b>Test case 1</b></p>\n\n<p>In the first test case <b>N</b> equals to 4, <b>K</b> equals to 2, <b>A</b> equals to {1, 3, 4, 2}. The answer is <b>3</b>, because {1, 3, 4, 2} -> {1, 2, 3, 4}. <b>A<sub>2</sub></b> now is on the <b>3</b>-rd position.</p>\n\n<p><b>Test case 2</b></p>\n\n<p>In the second test case <b>N</b> equals to 5, <b>K</b> equals to 5, <b>A</b> equals to {1, 2, 3, 9, 4}. The answer is <b>4</b>, because {1, 2, 3, 9, 4} -> {1, 2, 3, 4, 9}. <b>A<sub>5</sub></b> now is on the <b>4</b>-th position.</p>\n\n<p><b>Test case 3</b></p>\n\n<p>In the third test case <b>N</b> equals to 5, <b>K</b> equals to 1, <b>A</b> equals to {1, 2, 3, 9, 4}. The answer is <b>1</b>, because {1, 2, 3, 9, 4} -> {1, 2, 3, 4, 9}. <b>A<sub>1</sub></b> stays on the <b>1</b>-th position.</p>\n\n<h3>Note</h3>\n\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Killers/_/Uncle+Johny\">\"Uncle Johny\"</a> is a real song performed by The Killers.</p>",
