In his eyes was the hunted look of a beast seeking some gap in the ring of his enemies.<br />     'Nay, Eomer, you do not fully understand the mind of Master Wormtongue,' said Gandalf, turning his piercing glance upon him. 'He is bold and cunning.     Even now he plays a game with peril and wins a throw.' </i>- Gandalf, trying to figure out Wormtongue's mind.<br /> <br /> In fact, Wormtongue's mind is a complicated system of evaluating various variables and parameters. In essence, each parameter is a uniform random floating point variable between 0 and 1 (inclusive). Further, his mind works on calculating best and worst-case values, which are equivalent to min/max of 2 expressions.<br /> <br /> For example, right now Wormtongue is calculating :<br /> 'Chances of escaping' = <b>max</b>('Theoden letting me go', 'Me killing everyone')<br /> 'Theoden letting me go' = <b>max</b>('Theoden is forgiving by nature', 'Gandalf advises him to let me go').<br /> 'Me killing everyone' = <b>min</b>('Me killing Gandalf', 'Me killing Theoden').<br /> <br /> So, you are given an expression consisting of independent uniform [0, 1] random variables, on which you have an expression consisting of \"<b>min</b>\", and \"<b>max</b>\" alone. Help Gandalf figure out Wormtongue's mind by finding the <b>expected value</b> of this expression.<br /><br />\n<h3>Input (STDIN):</h3>\n</p><p> The first line contains <b>T</b>, the number of test cases.<br /> Each test case consists of a single line describing the expression. The characters of the string are derived from the set {'<b>M</b>','<b>m</b>','<b>x</b>'}, where '<b>M</b>' stands for <b>max</b>, '<b>m</b>' stands for <b>min</b>, and '<b>x</b>' is a random variable<br /> Formally, in the expression tree, each node which asks for <b>max</b> is labeled as '<b>M</b>', each node which asks for <b>min</b> is labelled '<b>m</b>', and all the leaves are labeled '<b>x</b>'. The description of the expression is preorder traversal of this tree.<br /> For example, <b>Mxmxx</b> describes the expression <b>max(x1, min(x2, x3))</b>.<br /><br />\n<h3>Output (STDOUT):</h3>\n</p><p> For each test case, output one line which contains the <b>expected value</b> of the expression. <b>The results should be accurate within an error range of 10^-6.</b><br /><br />\n<h3>Constraints:</h3>\n</p><p><b>1 &lt;= T &lt;= 1,000<br /> 1 &lt;= input string length &lt;= 100</b><br /> <br /><br />\n<h3>Sample Input:</h3>\n</p><p> <span style=\"font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;\"> 4<br /> x<br /> mxx<br /> Mxx<br /> MmxxMxx </span><br /><br />\n<h3>Sample Output:</h3>\n</p><p> <span style=\"font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;\"> 0.500000<br /> 0.333333<br /> 0.666667<br /> 0.700000<br /> </span><br /><br />\n<h3>Notes/Explanation of Sample Input:</h3>\n</p><p> For the first test case, it asks for the mean of a random number between 0 and 1, which is 0.5.<br /> <br /> Note:<br /> It is recommended to use <b>long long</b> and <b>long double</b> data types in calculation to avoid precision errors.<br /> <br /> <br /> </p></body> </html> </p>\n",
