He was very happy to know, that the monsters are living in peace now.</p>\n<p>His friend Carol was so excited about Max's coming back, that he proposed everyone a brand new game. Unfortunately, all the Wild Things refused to play the game, except Max and K.W., so there were only three players playing the game.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/download/extimages/4e92b0bc21bd247da871da4a6fb7eb79.jpg\" height=\"200\" /></p>\n<p>The area, where the game takes place, is the Cartesian plane(<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_plane\">link</a>).</p>\n<p>There are <b>N</b> <i>interesting</i> points on the plane.  Each <i>interesting</i> point has integer coordinates. Also, all the <i>interesting</i> points form a strictly convex polygon(<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_polygon#Strict_convexity\">link</a>). </p>\n<p>There is no need to explain the rules of the game, but it's quite important to mention the preparation process:</p>\n<p>In order to play the game, the players(Max, K.W. and Carol) must choose three different <i>interesting</i> points<br />\nand plant  themselves there. Also, they must choose some positive integer <b>S</b>.</p>\n<p>\nLet's assume, that Max's <i>interesting</i> point is <b>A</b>, K.W.'s - <b>B</b> and Carol's - <b>C</b>.<br />\nIf the area of triangle <b>ABC</b> is greater than or equal to <b>S</b>, then the game will be <i>awesome</i>.<br />\n Otherwise, it will be <i>awful</i>.\n</p>\n<p>\nNow Max is on his way home. His head is filled up with the memories about the wonderful game he used to play with<br />\nhis friends. But there's the thing, that annoys him: he remembers, that he played the game <b>Q</b> times, but<br />\nhe can't recall any <i>interesting</i> point chosen by him!\n</p>\n<p>\nMax exactly remembers, that in the beginning of <b>i</b>'th game K.W. chose point <b>B</b> = <b>B<sub>i</sub></b>,<br />\nCarol chose point <b>C</b> = <b>C<sub>i</sub></b> and <b>S</b> was equal to <b>S<sub>i</sub></b>.<br />\nAlso, he remembers, that all the games were awesome.<br />\nSo, you are to calculate the number of different <i>interesting</i> points,<br />\nthat could be chosen by Max as <b>A</b> in the beginning of <b>i</b>'th game. This number can be equal to zero(in that case we can conclude, that <b>i</b>'th game wasn't awesome - anyway, just output zero).\n</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The first line of a test case contains two integers <b>N</b> and <b>Q</b>,<br />\ndenoting the number of the <i>interesting</i> points and the number of times Max played the game.</p>\n<p>The next <b>N</b> lines contain two integers <b>X<sub>i</sub></b> and <b>Y<sub>i</sub></b> each, denoting coordinates of <b>i</b>'th <i>interesting</i> point. The points are 1-indexed.</p>\n<p>The next <b>Q</b> lines contain three integers <b>B<sub>i</sub></b>, <b>C<sub>i</sub></b> and <b>S<sub>i</sub></b> each. In the beginning of <b>i</b>'th game K.W. chose point <b>B<sub>i</sub></b>'th <i>interesting</i> point, Carol chose <b>C<sub>i</sub></b>'th <i>interesting</i> point and <b>S</b> was equal to <b>S<sub>i</sub></b>.</p>\n<p>It's guaranteed, that the <i>interesting</i> points form a strictly convex polygon and are given in clockwise or counterclockwise order.</p>\n<p>It's also guaranteed, that there are no three vertices in the input that lie on one line and no point is given twice.</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>For each round of the game, output a single line containing the number of different <i>interesting</i> points, that could be chosen by Max as <b>A</b> in the beginning of the corresponding game.</p>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<p>3 \u2264 <b>N</b> \u2264 60000;</p>\n<p>1 \u2264 <b>Q</b> \u2264 250000;</p>\n<p><b>|X|</b>, <b>|Y|</b> \u2264 10<sup>8</sup>, for each <i>interesting</i> point;</p>\n<p>1 \u2264 <b>B </b> != <b>C</b> \u2264 <b>N</b>, <b>S</b> \u2264 10<sup>18</sup>, for each game.</p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n4 2\n0 0\n4 0\n7 3\n7 7\n1 4 1\n1 4 100\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n2\n0\n</pre><h3>Explanations</h3>\n<p>\nFor the first query, <b>A</b> could be equal to both 2 and 3;<br /><br />\nFor the second query, there are no possible variants for <b>A</b>.\n</p>\n",
