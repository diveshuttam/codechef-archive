They had been going for several hours with only brief halts, when Gandalf came to his first serious check. Before him stood a wide dark arch opening into three passages: all led in the same general direction, eastwards; but the left-hand passage plunged down, while the right-hand climbed up, and the middle way seemed to run on, smooth and level but very narrow.</i> - The Fellowship of the Ring are lost in the Mines.<br /> <br /> The Mines of Moria are a true testament of Dwarvish genius. And the Fellowship of the Ring are lost in the maze of rooms, halls and caverns. You have managed to acquire a copy of the blueprints, and if only you were part of the Fellowship, Gandalf need not have had to face the Balrog!<br /> <br /> In this problem, we consider the Mines as consisting of rectangular rooms with their sides aligned parallel to the X (West-East) and Y (South-North) axes. Some rooms are situated within other rooms. The boundaries of any two rooms have no point in common. The rooms are numbered 0 to <b>N</b>-1. Your task is to determine for each room <b>i</b>, which room would you enter if you exit room <b>i</b>. If you exit into the open, output <b>-1</b>.<br /> <br /> For example, if the blueprints of the Mines looked like:<br /> <br /> <img src=\"/download/mine.jpg\" alt=\"mine image\" /> <br /> <br /> Then, you should determine that:<br /> Room <b>0</b> exits into the open (<b>-1</b>)<br /> Room <b>1</b> exits into Room <b>0</b><br /> Room <b>2</b> exits into Room <b>1</b><br /> Room <b>3</b> exits into the open (<b>-1</b>)<br /> <br /><br />\n<h3>Input (STDIN):</h3>\n</p><p> The first line contains an integer <b>N</b> followed by N lines. The i'th line defines the coordinates of the i'th room in the mines: <b>x1_i, y1_i, x2_i, y2_i</b>, where <b>(x1_i, y1_i)</b> are the coordinates of the southwest corner and <b>(x2_i, y2_i)</b> are the coordinates of the northeast corner of the i'th room.<br /> <br /><br />\n<h3>Output (STDOUT):</h3>\n</p><p> Output <b>N</b> lines, the i'th line containing the number of the room into which the i'th room exits. Output <b>-1</b> if the i'th room exits into the open.<br /><br />\n<h3>Constraints:</h3>\n</p><p> <b>1 &lt;= N &lt;= 100,000<br /> 0 &lt;= x1_i &lt; x2_i &lt;= 1,000,000,000<br /> 0 &lt;= y1_i &lt; y2_i &lt;= 1,000,000,000<br /> The borders of no two rooms have any point in common.</b><br /> <br /><br />\n<h3>Sample Input:</h3>\n</p><p> <span style=\"font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;\"> 4<br /> 0 0 10 10<br /> 2 3 7 8<br /> 3 4 5 6<br /> 12 10 13 15<br /> </span><br /><br />\n<h3>Sample Output:</h3>\n</p><p> <span style=\"font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;\"> -1<br /> 0<br /> 1<br /> -1<br /> </span><br />\n<h3>Notes/Explanation of Sample Input:</h3>\n</p><p> Given in the diagram. <br /> </p></body> </html> </p>\n",
