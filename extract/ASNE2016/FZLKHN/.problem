As badass as he is, Gray Khan is a total newbie at programming (he won\u2019t admit it though) and he has ordered you to help him complete the task.</p>\n<p>Now, the task is as follows. You are given an integer <b>N</b> and you have to choose a subset from numbers ranging from <b>1</b> to <b>N</b> and suppose we call it <b>S</b>. All the entries in <b>S</b> are distinct.</p>\n<p>The chosen subset <b>S</b> should be such that you can form all numbers from <b>1</b> to <b>N</b> using sum of the numbers of any subset of <b>S</b>.</p>\n<p>The main task is to minimise the number of the elements of the subset <b>S</b> and if there are several possible subsets with the same minimum size you have tell the subset <b>S</b> with minimum possible sum of all elements.</p>\n<p>Since Gray Khan has to complete the task by today help him as soon as possible.</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>There are several test cases. The first line of the input will be the number of test cases <b>T</b> and in the next <b>T</b> lines there will be an integer <b>N</b>.</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>Output <b>T</b> lines each containing minimum number of elements of subset S and their sum for that particular test case separated by spaces.</p>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>T</b> \u2264 <b>10^5</b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>N</b> \u2264 <b>10^9</b></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n2\n1\n8<br />\n<b>Output:</b>\n1 1\n4 10\n</pre><h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p><b>Example case 1</b>: The set {1} is optimal.</p>\n<p><b>Example case 2</b>: The set {1,2,3,4} is optimal.</p>\n",
