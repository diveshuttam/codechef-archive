As you might guess by the title , NSIT is very unpopular.</p>\n<p>\nSomeday some guy came from the land of \u201cThe World was there\u201d and after underestimating Gande, challenged him to solve a so called brutal problem which was never solved in their world.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe problem states that given <b>N</b> servers and <b>N-1</b> bidirectional wires you have to connect them all such that there is a path between every server (directly or indirectly). Now, out of <b>N-1</b> wires each wire has a length C.  Any wire can be used to connect any pair of the given <b>N</b> servers. The cost of the network is calculated in two terms:<br />\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Sum of lengths of all the wires used to connect.</li>\n<li>Sum of <b>degree(u) * degree(v)</b> for all ordered pairs  u,v such that  u!=v   (u and v are servers)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\n<br />The cost of the network is sum of the above two terms.<br />\n<br /><br />\nGandey has to <b>maximise</b> this cost.<br /><br />\nAlthough being a student of NSIT, Gandey can easily solve this problem very quickly but he has plans with Ms. Ghatak ! So , please solve this problem while Gandey and Ghatak are watching movie.\n</p>\n<h3> Clarifications </h3>\n<ol>\n<li> Indirect connection means that if u and v are connected , and , v and w are connected that implies u and w are connected. </li>\n<li> By ordered pair problem means that (u,v) is different from (v,u).</li>\n<li> By Degree of a Server, problem means the number of bidirectional wires connected to it.</li>\n<li> It can be proven that you can always connect <b>N</b> servers with <b>N-1</b> wires</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The first line of the input contains an integer <b>T</b> denoting the number of test cases. The description of <b>T</b> test cases follows.</li>\n<li>The first line of each test case contains a two integers <b>N</b> and <b>C</b> denoting the number of servers and length  of each  wire. </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>\nFor each test case, output a single line containing the maximum cost possible.</p>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>T</b> \u2264 <b>10</b></li>\n<li><b>2</b> \u2264 <b>N</b> \u2264 <b>500</b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>C</b> \u2264 <b>1000</b></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n1\n2 1\n<p></p>\n<b>Output:</b>\n3</pre>",
