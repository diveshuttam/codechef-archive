All the Teams must be registered on Codechef. Then the team can participate by registering at this link: <a href=\"/teams/register/SOPC2012/\">http://www.codechef.com/teams/register/SOPC2012/</a>. You cannnot register a team once the contest is started.</p> <p>5. All the teams must have to register on the SOPC page as well.</p> <p>6.

You will receive one point for solving a problem (passing all test cases - no partial credit), regardless of the level of difficulty of that problem.</p> <p>2. Users are ranked according to the most problems solved. Ties will be broken by the total time for each user in ascending order of time.</p> <p>3. The decision of the organizers in declaring the results will be final. No queries in this regard will be entertained.</p> <p>4. Any participant found to be indulging in any form of malpractice will be immediately disqualified. Admins have the authority to suspend/disqualify any team at any stage of the contest, if they suspect any malpractices/plagiarism.</p> <p>5. The total time is the sum of the time consumed for each problem solved. The time consumed for a solved problem is the time elapsed from the beginning of the contest to the submission of the first accepted run plus 20 penalty minutes for every previously rejected run for that problem. There is no time consumed for a problem that is not solved.</p> <p>6. The constraints on time, memory, etc. shall be specified separately for each problem.</p> <p>7. For all the problems, unless otherwise specified, the input should be read from stdin and the output should be written to stdout.</p> <p>8. Maximum of 20 submissions will be allowed for a problem.</p> <p>9. No system calls will be allowed, other than reading from stdin and writing to stdout.</p> <p>10. Compilation will be done on gcc/g++ (version 3.2.3)/openJDK. We advise you to write compiler version independent code.</p>",
