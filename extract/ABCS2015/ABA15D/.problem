It is assumed that, there exists  at least one knight such that it could reach the positions of all other knights in the board.This special knight could either belong to Sydow or Bengt.Sydow gets defeated, if he or Bengt loses at least one knight. He doesn\u2019t want this to happen.\n</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>\nTo safeguard him from losing, Sydow is given a chance to assign a colour to all the pieces in the board. He is given with \u2018K\u2019 colour boxes to paint the pieces,before the start of the game. Your task is to find the number of possible ways of assigning the colours to the pieces in the board such that Sydow wins with such arrangement.Print the answer modulo (10^9 + 7).</p>\n<p><br /><br /><br />\n<b>Input:</b><br />\n<br /><br /><br />\nThe first line consists of an integer \u2018T\u2019, the number of test cases.\u2019T\u2019 test cases follow:<br /><br />\nEach of the test cases consists of a single line containing three integers N,K and C.<br />\n<br />C is 0 if Sydow starts the game and 1 if Bengt starts the game.<br />\n<br /><br /><br />\n<b>Constraints:</b><br />\n<br /><br /><br />\n1&lt;=T&lt;=10<br /><br />\n1&lt;=N&lt;=10000000<br /><br />\n1&lt;=K&lt;=1000000000<br /><br />\n0&lt;=C&lt;=1<br /><br />\n<br /><br />\n<b>Output:</b><br />\n<br /><br /><br />\nFor each test case, print the number of ways in a single line.Print \"0\" if Sydow could not win the game with any arrangement.(Quotes for clarity)<br />\n<br /><br /><br />\n<b>Example:</b><br />\n<br /><br />\n<br /><br />\n<b>Input#1:</b><br /><br /><br />\n1<br /><br />\n2 2 1<br /><br />\n<br /><br />\n<b>Output#1:</b><br /><br /><br />\n2<br /></p>\n",
