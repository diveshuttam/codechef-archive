A lobby boy is completely invisible, yet always in sight. A lobby boy remembers what people hate. A lobby boy anticipates the client's needs before the needs are needed. A lobby boy is, above all, discreet to a fault. Our guests know that their deepest secrets, some of which are frankly rather unseemly, will go with us to our graves. So keep your mouth shut, Zero. \"</i><br /><br /><br />\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 -M.Gustave</p>\n<p>Gustave is fond of cakes. Gustave's birthday is falling soon and so Mr.Zero thinks of gifting him N cakes. ( N is the age of M.Gustave ).

Assume that the Cakes are hybrid varieties and so are not perishable .Zero decides to buy at-least one cake everyday. He has to collect N cakes within H days .( H being the number of days remaining for Gustave's birthday).
