In this problem, you must write a program to find the maximum degree of separation for a network of people. \nFor any two people, the degree of separation is the minimum number of relationships that must be traversed to connect the two people. For a network, the maximum degree of separation is the largest degree of separation between any two people in the network. If there is a pair of people in the network who are not connected by a chain of relationships, the network is disconnected. \nAs shown below in example, a network can be described as a set of symmetric relationships each of which connects two people. A line can be assumed to represent a relationship between two people. Network in example 1 illustrates a network with 2 as the maximum degree of separation. Network in example 2 is disconnected.\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p> The input consists of data sets that describe networks of people. For each data set, the first line has two integers: P (2 &le; P &le; 50), the number of people in the network, and R (R &ge; 1), the number of network relationships. Following that first line are R relationships. Each relationship consists of two strings that are names of people in the network who are related. Names are unique and contain no blank spaces. Because a person may be related to more than one other person, a name may appear multiple times in a data set. \nThe final test case is followed by a line containing two zeroes.\nFor eg- \nconsider a relationship in which\nA<->B shows relationship between A and B\nSimilarly, B is related to C i.e, B<->C and C is related to D i.e, C<->D. So, A is somehow related to D i.e,\n A<->B<->C<->D  and degree of separation is 3.\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>\nFor each network, display the network number followed by the maximum degree of separation. If the network is disconnected, display DISCONNECTED. Use the format illustrated in the sample output.\n\n\n<h3>Example</h3>\n\n<pre>\n<b>Input:</b>\n4 4\nA B\nC D\nB C\nA C\n<b>Output:</b>\n2\n<b>Input:</b>\n4 2\nA B\nC D\n<b>Output:</b>\nDISCONNECTED\n\n</pre>",
