Each level requires certain amount of time to finish. Every level is also characterised by two other parameters <strong>XP_needed </strong>and <strong>XP_gain</strong>. The time units need to finish, minimum experience needed and experience gain of the i-th level is given by <strong>T[ i ]</strong> , <strong>XP_needed[ i ] </strong>and <strong>XP_gain[ i ]</strong>, respectively. Sherlock can play the <strong>i</strong>-th level if his current XP is greater than or equal to <strong>XP_needed[ i ]</strong>. Once he finishes the i-th level his XP will increase by <strong>XP_gain[ i ]</strong>.  Sherlock is busy working on a case and he has <strong>X</strong> time units to spare. His initial XP is <strong>Y</strong>. He wants to complete as many levels as possible within the time. Help him find out the maximum number of levels he can play and the minimum XP that he would have required to finish that many levels within <strong>X</strong> units of time. (XP cannot be negative)</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>First line contains three space separated integers N, X and Y.</li>\n<li>Next N lines contains three space separated integers.
