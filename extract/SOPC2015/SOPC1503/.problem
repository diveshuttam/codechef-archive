He plays a game called \"stupid question\" in which the hero of the game is a saviour of Tatooine , and the game is about saving people by taking them to another galaxy with the help of spaceships. It is a superb game except the stupid question it asks before each mission that needs to be answered to enter the corresponding mission. Now Anakin is in his last mission where he is given <b>N</b> spaceships each having some maximum limit of people it can hold and there are <b>M</b> people who are all graphic models, so that they all can be treated identical. At this point the game asks its stupid question \"How many possible ways are there in which these people can be arranged into these <b>N</b> spaceships?\" , He gets irked and gets stuck with this question , So can you help Anakin answer this stupid question?</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>First line contains 2 space separated integers <b>N</b> and <b>M</b> , And second line contains <b>N</b> space separated integers each representing the maximum number of people the corresponding spaceship can hold.</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>A single line each containing a number, which is the number of possible solutions for the given case</p>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>N</b> \u2264 <b>25</b> </li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>M</b> \u2264 <b>25</b> </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n2 3\n5 5\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n4\n</pre><h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p>When <b>N</b> =2 and <b>M</b>=3 there are 2 spaceship and 3 people , spaceship 1 and spaceship 2 have their maximum capacity as 5 people , then number possible distribution of people is (3,0) (0,3) (2,1) (1,2)<br />\n Therefore answer is 4.\n</p>\n",
