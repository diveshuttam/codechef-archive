Posting questions clarifying       the problem statement is ok. If you are unsure, email us at       <a href=\"mailto:feedback@codechef.com\" target=\"_blank\"> feedback@codechef.com </a>. </li>\r\n<li>Discussing CodeChef's problems or any aspect of problem, on any other platform on web, on identification, could lead       to disabling of respective account and banning from the community. </li>\r\n<li>Almost all languages supported on CodeChef are allowed.</li>\r\n<li>Each program will be tested based on our critical test data.

As a contestant, you are responsible for making sure others don't access the code that you submit. If you    use Ideone, make sure to mark your submission \"private\" (not secret)\".</p>",
