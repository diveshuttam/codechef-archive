You've got into BUET, took CSE and now ready to live happily ever after!\n\nBut wait! You just found out that your crush took EEE. Moreover, she hates coding! So all your dreams of impressing her with your topnotch coding skills are now in vain. But you also found out that she loves bitwise operations a lot!\n\nSo one day your crush tells you about an interesting thing she did with bitwise XOR-s . She took all the numbers from $1$ to $n$ and wrote down their multiples up to $n$. So if $n$ $=$ $4$, then  she wrote down the multiples of $1$ upto $4$ $\\{1,2,3,4\\}$, multiples of $2$ upto $4$ $\\{2,4\\}$, multiples of $3$ upto $4$ $\\{3\\}$ and the multiples of $4$ upto $4$ $\\{4\\}$. Then she wrote the XOR-sum of all these numbers in her favorite diary. Now she's asking you if you can guess that number written in her diary. So can you finally impress her?  \n\n${\\bullet}$ XOR-sum  of numbers $p$, $q$ and $r$ means $p$ $\\mathbin{\\oplus}$ $q$ $\\mathbin{\\oplus}$ $r$.\n\n${\\bullet}$ The XOR-operator is denoted as \"$\\wedge$\" in C/C++/Java.\n\n\n###Input :\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer $t$ $(1 \\leq t \\leq 100)$  denoting the number of test cases. The description of $t$ test cases follows.\n\nThe first and only line of each test case contains a single integer $n$ $(1 \\leq n \\leq 10^9$).\n\n\n###Ouput: \n\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer - the number in your crush's diary.\n\n###Sample Input:\n\n$4$\n\n$1$\n\n$4$\n\n$12$\n\n$10272025$\n\n###Sample Output:\n\n$1$\n\n$5$\n\n$12$\n\n$16758533$\n\n###Note:\n\nFor $n = 4$,\n\nThe multiples of $1$ up to $4$ are $1 , 2, 3, 4$.\nThe multiples of $2$ up to $4$ are $2, 4$.\nThe multiple of $3$ up to $4$ is $3$ and the multiple of $4$ up to $4$ is $4$.\n\nTheir XOR-sum will be $1$ $\\mathbin{\\oplus}$ $2$ $\\mathbin{\\oplus}$ $3$ $\\mathbin{\\oplus}$ $4$ $\\mathbin{\\oplus}$ $2$ $\\mathbin{\\oplus}$ $4$ $\\mathbin{\\oplus}$ $3$ $\\mathbin{\\oplus}$ $4$ $=$ $5$\n\n$\\textbf{Basic XOR-operations}$\n\n${\\bullet}$ $0$ $\\mathbin{\\oplus}$ $0$ $=$ $0$\n\n${\\bullet}$ $0$ $\\mathbin{\\oplus}$ $1$ $=$ $1$\n\n${\\bullet}$ $1$ $\\mathbin{\\oplus}$ $0$ $=$ $1$\n\n${\\bullet}$ $1$ $\\mathbin{\\oplus}$ $1$ $=$ $0$\n\n\nFor example, suppose we're calculating the XOR of $10$ and $12$.\nNow, the binary representation of $10$ is $1010$ and the binary representation of $12$ is $1100$\n\nSo, their XOR is $1010$ $\\mathbin{\\oplus}$ $1100$ $=$ $0110$ which is the binary representation of $6$.\n",
