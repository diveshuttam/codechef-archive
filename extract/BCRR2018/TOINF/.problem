Today is **AutoCAD** lab quiz and after getting the question paper, Rafid just found out he has been asked to draw the isometric view of BUET Medical Center. Realizing that another **'F'** is coming, he starts to write all the integers from 1 to infinity serially in the question paper. But each number is written as many times as the number of its positive divisors. So, his list is : $1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 6, 7, 7, \u2026\u2026$\n\nNow he is thinking if it\u2019s easy to find out some $k$'th number of this list. However, he is a really poor problem solver. So, he wants you to solve the problem for him.\n\nYou have to answer $q$ queries. In each query, a single integer $k$ is given. You have to print the $k$'th number of Rafid\u2019s list.\n\n\n###Input\n\nThe first line of input contains a single integer $q$ $(1 \u2264 q \u2264 5\u00d710^5)$. Each of the following $q$ lines contain a single integer $k$ $(1 \u2264 k \u2264 10^8)$.\n\n\n###Output\n\nFor each query, output a single integer in a separate line, the $k$\u2019th number of Rafid\u2019s list. It is guaranteed that the answer will never exceed $6.5\u00d710^6$.\n\n\n###Note\n\nInput file is huge in size. Use faster I/O **(scanf/printf)**.\n\n\n###Sample Input\n\n$4$\n\n$1$\n\n$3$\n\n$2$\n\n$8$\n\n\n###Sample Output\n\n$1$\n\n$2$\n\n$2$\n\n$4$",
