He has lost all hope about this. Thinking that he will never have any love in his life he started to think about love between numbers. According to him two numbers are in love with each other if their bitwise-xor and sum are equal. For example: bitwise-xor of $160$ and $75$ is $235$ and their sum is also $235$. Hence $160$ and $75$ are in love with each other. On the other hand the bitwise-xor of $32$ and $63$ is $31$ but their sum is $95$. Hence $32$ and $63$ are not lovers.\n\nIn this problem Saifullah will ask you $Q$ questions. In each question he will give you a number $X$. Your task is to find out the largest lover of $X$ not exceeding $X$ and the smallest lover of $X$ greater than $X$. If any of the answer doesn\u2019t exist simply print $-1$.\n\n###Input:\n\nThe first line of input will contain a single integer $Q$ ($1 \\leq Q \\leq 10^5$). The number of questions.\nIt will be followed by $Q$ lines each containing a single integer $X$ ($0 \\leq X \\leq 10^9$). \n\n###Output:\nFor each question, output in a single line the answer to the problem. Print the largest lover of $X$ not exceeding $X$ and the smallest lover of $X$ greater than $X$ separated by a single pace.\n\n###Sample Input:\n$5$   \n$8 $  \n$36$  \n$1995$   \n$536870911 $    \n$1000000000 $   \n\n\n\n###Sample Output:\n$7$ $16$   \n$27$ $64$        \n$52$ $2048$     \n$0$ $536870912$          \n$73741823$ $1073741824$       \n\n\n",
