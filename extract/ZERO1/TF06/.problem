Assume there are infinite candies. The boxes are arranged in increasing order of capacity, and the i<sup>th</sup> box has capacity i. Every box has a specific cost c<sub>i</sub>. You fill candies in rounds. In every round, you pick a subset of boxes and fill them with candies. This subset should be such that each subsequent box picked in a round should be more spacious than the previous one. Also, the difference in cost of consecutive boxes should be at least K. <br/><br/><br />\nWhat is the least number of rounds in which all boxes could be filled. </br/></br/></p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The first line contains the number of test cases T. T test cases follow. <br/><br />\nEach case contains an integer N and K on the first line, followed by integers c<sub>1</sub>,...,c<sub>n</sub> on the second line. <br/><br />\n1 &lt;= T &lt;= 100 <br/><br />\n1 &lt;= N &lt;= 300 <br/><br />\n1 &lt;= ci &lt;= 1000 <br/><br />\n1 &lt;= K &lt;= 1000 <br/></br/></br/></br/></br/></br/></br/></p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>Output T lines, one for each test case, containing the minimum number of rounds in which all boxes could be filled.</p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre>\n<b>Input:</b>\n2\n3 2\n5 4 7\n5 1\n5 3 4 5 6\n\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n2\n1\n</pre><p>\n<br/><br />\n<b>Explanation:</b></br/></p>\n<p>For the first example, you can fill the boxes of cost 5 and 7 in the first round and the box with cost 4 in the next round. Note that the boxes with cost 5 and 4 cannot be filled consecutively because the costs should differ by at least K (which is 2). Also, the boxes cannot be filled in order 5,7,4 in one round because the boxes filled in a round should be in increasing capacity.</p>\n",
