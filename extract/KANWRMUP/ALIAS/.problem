Consider a set of n persons and assume that each person has k distinct aliases. A person is identified using any one of its k aliases. The nk (=n x k) distinct aliases are identified using integers 1, 2,...nk. Integers 1, 2,..., n represent the first aliases of all n persons in an arbitrary order. In general, integers (j-1) x n +1, (j-1) x n +2,..., (j-1) x n +n represent the jth alias of all n persons in an arbitrary order, for j=1, 2,..., k. Persons in the set are totally ordered with respect to a quality characteristic Q associated with each person. Let Q(r) be the value of Q for a person identified by one of its alias r. \nGiven a sufficient number, say m, of inequalities of the type: Q(r) > Q(s), you are required to write a program to sort all persons in descending order and recognize all aliases of each person in the set.\nAs a simple illustration consider distinct total marks scored by three students in an examination. Each student is identified by any one of three distinct aliases in the Name: {first-name middle-name last-name}. Let integers 1, 2, 3 represent the first names, 4, 5, 6 represent the middle names and 7, 8, 9 represent the last names in an arbitrary order. Let Q(r) be the total marks of student r, r being an alias. Given the following inequalities: Q(6) > Q(1), Q(9) > Q(4), Q(5) > Q(8), Q(2) > Q(9), Q(7) > Q(3), Q(9) > Q(3), one can conclude that the names of students appearing in descending order of total marks are {2 6 7}, {1 5 9} and {3 4 8}.\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The input may contain multiple test cases. \nFor each test case the first input line gives the parameters n, k and m. \nThe second line contains m inequalities represented by 2 x m integers. An integer r occurring in an odd numbered position in the line and the integer s occurring in the next even numbered position, represent the inequality Q(r) > Q(s).\nAssume that nk is less than 100 and each integer in the second input line is of two digits, including a non-significant 0 when required.\nThe input terminates with a line containing 0 as input.\n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>For each test case print n lines giving k aliases of each person in a line; a line contains aliases in increasing order. Arrange persons in descending order of the quality characteristic Q. As in input, each integer in output is of two digits, including a non-significant 0 when required.\nA blank line appears after the last output line of a test case.\n\n<h3>Example</h3>\n\n<pre>\n<b>Input:</b>\n3 3 6\n06 01 09 04 05 08 02 09 07 03 09 03\n2 4 2\n03 08 02 05\n0\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n02 06 07\n01 05 09\n03 04 08\n\n02 03 06 07\n01 04 05 08 \n</pre>\n",
