He took an N-letter password and found all the possible\n2-letter substrings, considering the characters of a password was written in a circle. Thus, for AbcD, he would deduce the following\nsubstrings: Ab, bc, cD, DA.\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">\nThen, some of the substrings were reversed. For example, the set of substrings above could be converted to Ab, cb, Dc, DA. All\nthe substrings were then stored in a database. Whenever the need be, the substrings were recovered, and a password was generated. Of course\nsometimes, more than one such password could be generated, but Chef thinks this is perfectly fine!\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">\nUnfortunately, a programming error by the new CodeChef minion, led to corruption of this database and mixed all the strings together.\nChef now wants to retrieve the passwords, a few at a time. He gives you a set of substrings A from some of the passwords - these you\nshould always consider, and another set of substrings B from which you can use some. Can you tell him if it is possible to select all the substrings\nfrom A and some (0 or more) substrings from B and construct 1 or more passwords? Each selected string can be used only once, for at max 1\npassword. See explanation of Sample Input for clarification.\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">\n<h3>Input</h3>\nThe first Line contains a single number T, the number of test cases.\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">\nEach test case contains 2 lines.\nThe first line of the test case contains the number N (= |A|), followed by the N substrings Chef gives in A. The next line contains\nM (= |B|), followed by M substrings. Two substrings are input with a single space character between them.\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">\n<h3>Output</h3>\nPrint T lines, one for each test case. Output either \"YES\" if it is possible to select all strings from A and some strings from B\nsuch that the overall set of strings represent the substrings for 1 or more passwords. Output \"NO\" otherwise.\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<pre>1 \u2264 T \u2264 100\n1 \u2264 N \u2264 1000\n1 \u2264 M \u2264 1000\nAll characters would be upper case or lower case English letters. Passwords are case sensitive.\n</pre>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">\n<h3>Sample Input</h3>\n<pre>2\n4 aB aB Ca Bc\n6 aB Ca ca ab ba bc\n4 aB aB Ca Bc\n3 Ba aC bc\n</pre>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">\n<h3>Sample Output</h3>\n<pre>YES\nNO\n</pre>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">\n<h3>Explanation</h3>\nIn the first Sample Input, you can construct \"aBaC\" from (<strong>aB</strong> <strong>aB</strong> <strong>Ca</strong> Ca) and\n\"aBc\" from (<strong>Bc</strong> aB ca). Strings selected from A are shown in bold. Remember that substrings can be reversed. Note\nthat although there are repeated strings, each string is used in at most one of the passwords.\n</p>",
