All machines are supposed to produce coins of weight <b>A</b>. But, there is one faulty machine which produces coins of weight <b>B</b>. Write a program to find out which machine is faulty with the help of a weighing machine. The weighing machine cannot handle more than <b>S </b>coins at a time.</p>\n<p>Your program has to determine which coin producing machine is faulty in a series of at most <b>N </b>\u201cattempts\u201d.</p>\n<p>Now, what\u2019s an attempt?</p>\n<p>In each attempt, your program must ask the user (the OJ) for the weight of a combination of coins from different machines. If the combination adds up to more than <b>S </b>coins at a time, -1 is entered as input, the program terminates immediately and you get a WA. Otherwise, the user(the OJ) enters the weight of the given combination. After that, your program must print the serial number of the machine it thinks is faulty. If the guess is correct, the user enters 1 and the program terminates then and there (Gets Accepted). If it is incorrect, 0 is entered and you must move on to a new attempt.</p>\n<p><b>Input + Output Format</b></p>\n<p>\u00b7 At first, the user enters three lines of input as follows:</p>\n<p>Line 1 contains a single positive integer N.</p>\n<p>Line 2 contains space separated positive integers A and B.</p>\n<p>Line 3 contains a single positive integer B.</p>\n<p>\u00b7 Now begins your series of attempts...</p>\n<p>In each attempt:</p>\n<p>1. Your program must print N space separated positive integers, where the nth<sup> </sup>integer denotes the number of coins to be taken from the nth<sup> </sup>machine.</p>\n<p>2. Next, the user enters the weight of the combination of coins described by your program as a single positive integer in a new line.</p>\n<p>3. Now, the program should print the serial number of the machine it thinks is faulty.</p>\n<p>4. 0/1 is entered as described in the statement.</p>\n<p>Your program must terminate on its own when:</p>\n<p>\u00d8 When its guess is correct, 1 is entered by the user (OJ) and it is made to terminate.</p>\n<p><b>Verdict: </b>AC <b>Score=</b><i>1.0 / (Number of Attempts*Number of Coins taken over all attempts)</i></p>\n<p>\u00d8 When N attempts are over and it has failed to make a correct guess.</p>\n<p><b>Verdict: </b>WA <b>Score</b>=0</p>\n<p>\u00d8 When the total number of coins in the combination it just described exceeds <b>S</b>. Or, when it prints negative values (The OJ is smarter...:P). In both cases -1 is entered. </p>\n<p><b>Verdict: </b>WA <b>Score</b>=0</p>\n<p>...Or else it\u2019s going to get TLE and score 0.</p>\n<p>None of the integers will exceed 32 bits.</p>\n<p><b>Note: </b>If you take no coins at all, your score will be 0 and not infinity (Although your solution will be accepted).</p>\n<p><b>Sample IO </b></p>\n<p>*Input #Output</p>\n<p>*3 </p>\n<p>*1 2</p>\n<p>*4</p>\n<p>#1 1 1</p>\n<p>*4 </p>\n<p>#3</p>\n<p>*0</p>\n<p>#1 2 1</p>\n<p>*6 </p>\n<p>#2</p>\n<p>*1</p>\n<p><b>Score: </b>1/(2*7)=1/14=0.071</p>\n<p> Your final score is the sum of your scores over all the test cases.</p>\n<p> Check out this (<a href=\"http://cpp.sh/92ax\" title=\"http://cpp.sh/92ax\">http://cpp.sh/92ax</a>) sample solution which is being accepted, but scores a zero, because it simply guesses the answer over N attempts, and asks for the weight of zero coins over all attempts.</p>\n",
