Each day, they would target a particular street of Byte-land and would make life miserable for its inhabitants.</p>\n\n<p>As we all know, team work can take pranks to new heights. The i<sup>th </sup>kid would dirty the walls of the houses numbered <b>X<sub>i\u00ad</sub></b>, <b>2*X<sub>i\u00ad</sub></b>, <b>3*X<sub>i\u00ad</sub> </b>and so on...where <b>X<sub>i\u00ad </sub></b>is the i<sup>th</sup> integer in the street\u2019s ID. </p>\n\n<p>But, before they begin their prank, the oldest son would like to pre-compute the percentage of houses in that particular street, whose walls would remain clean even after they are over with their prank. Write a program to compute it efficiently.</p>\n\n<p><b>Input</b></p>\n\n<p>The first line of each test file consists of 2 space separated integers...<b>N </b>&<b> K</b>.</p>\n\n<p>The next line contains K space separated integers, which form the ID of the targeted street.</p>\n\n<p><b>Output</b></p>\n\n<p>Your output consists of a single integer...the % of houses whose walls would remain clean, with a relative error of no more than 10^-2.</p>\n\n<p><b>Constraints</b></p>\n\n<p>\uf0b7 N&lt;=10<sup>9</sup></p>\n\n<p>\uf0b7 K&lt;21</p>\n\n<p>\uf0b7 X<sub>i </sub>&lt;...well, it has to be a number between 1 and N.</p>\n\n<p><b>Sample Input</b></p>\n\n<p>10 3</p>\n\n<p>3 2 5</p>\n\n<p><b>Sample Output</b></p>\n\n<p>20</p>\n\n<p><b>Explanation</b></p>\n\n<p>The street has got 20 houses. And Chef has got 3 kids.</p>\n\n<p>The 1<sup>st </sup>kid will dirty the walls of houses numbered: 3, 6 and 9. (X<sub>1</sub>=3)</p>\n\n<p>The 2<sup>nd </sup>kid will dirty the walls of houses numbered: 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10. (X<sub>2</sub>=2) </p>\n\n<p>The 3<sup>rd </sup>kid will dirty the walls of houses numbered: 5 and 10. (X<sub>3</sub>=5)</p>\n\n<p>Hence, only the houses numbered 1 & 7 will remain unaffected...and hence 20%.</p>\n",
