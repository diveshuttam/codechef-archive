Hours of coding have become a cause of abhays severe headache and he desperately needs a break now so he thinks of organizing a party at his place. Interestingly abhay has invited equal number of men and women (who are his colleagues) to the party and wants to start the party with a group photograph abhay is also a keen mathematician and wants to know a special number called COSUK which is the sum of the digits of the number of arrangements of n men and n women. Being intoxicated in the bash he asks you to implement a calculator that calculates this special number.\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>\nThe input to the problem is a number T the number of test cases and then T test cases follow with a number n on each subsequent line indicating the number of men and women invited to the party. (T<=10000 & 0<=n<=200)\n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>\nOutput the number COSUK.\nCOSUK = sum of digits of the number indicating the number of arrangements of the n men and n woman.\nOutput your answer mod 100000007 (mod means %).\n\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre>\n\n<b>Input:</b>\n2\n0\n1\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n1\n1\n</pre>\n",
