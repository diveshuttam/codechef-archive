Sankar's budget for spending is 'M' rupees. Sankar is a clever guy. He never spends more than his budget. A ride 'i' costs 'Ci' rupees. Sankar had 'K' discount coupons which he got from his friend Sivakumar. If Sankar uses a coupon on a ride 'i', then the ride costs 'Di' rupees instead of 'Ci' rupees. But the condition to use a coupon is that \"He can use atmost one coupon per ride\". The more the number of rides Sankar and his girl friend take, the more their love increases. Help Sankar find the maximum number of rides he can take, provided he doesn't spend more than his budget.\n\n<b>Note: Same ride cant be taken again. A ride can be taken only once.</b>\n</p>\n\n\n<h3><b>Input</b></h3>\n<p>\nThere are multiple test case files. \n<br><br>\nThe first line of each test case has three space separated integers N, K and M.<br>\nThen follows N lines, each line consists two space separated integers Ci and Di, the original cost of the ith ride and the \n\ncost of the ith ride if the coupon is used on it.\n</p>\n\n<h3><b>Output</b></h3>\n<p>\nFor each test case, output on a single line, the maximum number of rides they can take.\n</p>\n\n<h3><b>Constraints</b></h3>\n<p>\n1 <= N <= 50,000<br>\n1 <= K <= N<br>\n1 <= M <= 10^14<br>\n1 <= Ci <= 10^9<br>\n1 <= Di <= Ci<br>\n</p>\n\n<h3><b>Example</b></h3>\n<pre><b>Input</b>\n4 1 7\n3 2\n2 2\n8 1\n4 3\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n3\n\n</pre>\n\n<h3><b>Explanation</b></h3>\n<p>\nHe has 7 rupees and only one coupon. He would use the coupon on the 3rd ride (1 based index, i.e., the ride which costs 8 \n\n1). With remaining 6 rupees, he can ride either (1st and 2nd) or (2nd and 4th). So, totally 3.\n</p>",
