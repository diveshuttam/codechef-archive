Usually the games offered to play \n\nwill be Counterstrike, FIFA, NFS etc. Krishna is appointed as the organiser of this Gamindrome event in Kurukshetra 2016. \n\nBeing an innovative person, Krishna decides to try something different this time. In addition to the traditional games \n\nwhich were offered to play, Krishna introduces a new game called \"<b>Ballindrome</b>\". The game definition is as follows:\n<br><br>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\t\t\nIt is a singleplayer game. Krishna has 'n' boxes with various coloured balls in it. There are 'm' different colours \n\nnumbered from 1 through m. Krishna decided that he will choose some boxes in a way that atleast one ball in each colour is \n\npresent. The player must determine the number of ways in which Krishna can do this. If the player finds the answer \n\ncorrectly, he wins the game. Otherwise he has to give 5 bucks to Krishna. Many coders have lost this game to Krishna. \n\nKrishna has now earned 1000 bucks from that. Being greedy, Krishna wants to earn more quickly. You, being a great \n\nprogrammer is challenged by Krishna. If you solved it, you will get all of those 1000 bucks. Otherwise, you will have to \n\npay another 1000 bucks. It has now become a <b>prestige</b> issue for you. Can you win this game ? Let's wait and watch \n\nwho wins :P\n\n</p>\n\n<h3><b>Input</b></h3>\n<p>\nThere will be multiple test case files.<br>\nOne such file will be as follows:<br><br>\n\nThe first line contains two space separated integers 'n' and 'm'.<br>\nEach of the following 'n' lines contain an integer ki (0 <= ki <= m) followed by ki distinct integers from interval [1,m], \n\nrepresenting the balls in that box.\n</p>\n\n<h3><b>Output</b></h3>\n<p>\nFor each test case, output on a single line, the requested number of ways modulo 10^9+7.\n</p>\n\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<p>\n1 <= n <= 10^6<br>\n1 <= m <= 20<br>\n</p>\n\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre>\n<b>Input #1:</b>\n3 3\n3 1 2 3\n3 1 2 3\n3 1 2 3\n\n<b>Output #1:</b>\n7\n\n<b>Input #2:</b>\n3 3\n1 1\n1 2\n1 3\n\n<b>Output #2:</b>\n1\n\n<b>Input #3:</b>\n4 5\n2 2 3\n2 1 2\n4 1 2 3 5\n4 1 2 4 5\n\n<b>Output #3:</b>\n6\n</pre>\n\n\n<h3><b>Explanation</b></h3>\n<p><b>Example case 1</b>\nThere are 3 boxes. There are 3 colours. All the three boxes contains balls of all three colours. Krishna can choose in the \n\nfollowing ways:\n<br><br>\n{1}, {1,2}, {1,3}, {2}, {2,3}, {3}, {1,2,3}. So, total = 7.\n</p>\n<p><b>Example case 2</b>\nThere are 3 boxes and three different colours. Box 1 contains balls of colour 1, box 2 contains balls of colour 2 and box \n\n3 contains balls of colour 3. So, there is only one way of choosing boxes which consists of balls of all 3 colours, i.e., \n\n{1,2,3}. So, total = 1.\n</p>\n",
