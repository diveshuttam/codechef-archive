Now to prevent more fighting, Skyler's sister has given both of them a problem to solve. Skyler is good at coding. But Walter who knows only about making meth asks for your help. \n<br>\n<br>\nIn the given problem you are given an input string <b>S</b> consisting of characters 'L' , 'R' , 'U' and 'D' meaning left, right, up and down respectively in the X-Y plane. For any given subsequence of the string, if a person starts from a certain point in the X-Y plane, he will end at some point in the X-Y plane if he follows the directions given in the subsequence.  \n<br><br>\nFor example, for string <b>S</b>=\"LLRUDD\" if we start from (1,1) and use a subsequence of string S \"LUDD\" we will end up at (0,0).\n<br><br>\nNow you will be given <b>Q</b> queries. For each query you will be given the coordinates of starting point in X-Y plane and the coordinates of ending point in the X-Y plane ( It is guaranteed that the starting and ending points are different ) . \n<br><br>\nFor each query, you need to print the number of ways of choosing a subsequence from the original string <b>S</b> such that  if one starts at the given starting point he will end at the given ending point.\n<br>\nSince the answer is large, print it modulo 10^9 + 7.\n</p>\n<p> </p>\n\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The first line of input contains the string <b>S</b>. In the next line you are given the number of queries <b>Q</b>. In each of the next <b>Q</b> lines, you are given 4 space separated integers X1,Y1, X2,Y2 - the x and y coordinates of starting and ending point respectively. \n\n</p>\n\n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>For each query, output the answer for that query in a new line.</p>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>Length of String S</b> \u2264 <b>400000</b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>Q</b> \u2264 <b>100000</b></li>\n<li><b>0</b> \u2264 <b>X1,Y1,X2,Y2</b> \u2264 <b>10^9</b></li>\n\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\nLRRUD\n1\n0 0 1 1\n<b>Output:</b>\n3\n</pre>\n<p> </p>\n<h3>Explanation</h3>\nThree subsequences of original string S \"LRRU\" , \"RU\", \"RU\" will result in the desired ending point if we start from the given starting point.\n</p>",
