But for this plan to work, he needs someone's help, a very specific person. And that person is Harley Quinn. He goes to Arkham Asylum to meet her. As we all know, she is a teeny tiny bit crazy. She wants Batman to play a little game, she likes to call it \"The Great Swap Game\" (She's intelligent, remember?). This is how the game works.<br />\nThey both get an array A of N numbers. They also get Q queries.<br />\nEach query comprises of a set of disjoint sub-arrays and a number K[i] related to each subarray. In each query, the game is played. The player can select a subarray make at most K[i] and at least 1 swap in that subarray on two adjjacent elements A[i] and A[i+1] such that A[i]>A[i+1] in his/her move. You can assume that both Batman and Harley Quinn play optimally. The game ends when a player cannot make a move and then, he/she loses. Given this data, you need to tell who will win given that Batman plays first (He's Batman, right?).\n</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The first line of test file contains the number of test cases T for that file.\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The second line contains two integer N and Q,size of the given array A and number of queries.\n</li>\n<li>The third line contains N space seperated integer, elements of array A.\n</li>\n<li>Then Q queries follow.\n</li>\n<li>First line of each query contains the number of sub-arrays S for that query.\n</li>\n<li>Then follows S lines containing 3 integers per line L[i], R[i] and K[i], left index of that sub-array, right index of that sub-array and K[i] as explained in the problem statement.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>Output Q lines where each line will be \"BATMAN\", if Batman wins for that query or \"HARLEY\" if he loses.\n</p>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Sum of N over all test cases &lt;= 100000\n</li>\n<li>Sum of no of subarrays over all queries and test cases &lt;= 10000\n</li>\n<li>A[i]&lt;=100000\n</li>\n<li>K[i]&lt;=100000\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n1\n5 1\n5 4 3 2 1\n3\n1 2 5\n3 3 6\n4 5 7\n\n<b>Output:</b>\nHARLEY\n\n</pre><p>\u00a0</p>\n",
