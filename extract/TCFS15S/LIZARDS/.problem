Not only are they afraid of bigger animals, they even get afraid when they see some other lizard staring at them.</p>\n<p> <b>N</b> lizards are standing in a line, each of them is either facing left or right. A pair of indices <b>(i,j)</b> (i &lt; j) is called an <i>afraid pair</i> if lizard at index i is facing right, and lizard at index j is facing left. </p>\n<p> <b>Q</b> queries are given, each query represented by two integers l and r (0 \u2264 l \u2264 r &lt; N). Query <b>l r</b> means flip direction of the lizards which have indices between l and r, inclusive. E.g., if the arrangement was LRRL then after query <b>1 3</b> it becomes LLLR. </p>\n<p> After each query, print the number of <i>afraid pairs</i> in the arrangement.</p>\n<h3>Input Description</h3>\n<p>First line contains single integer N<br />Next line contains N characters, each being either L or R.
