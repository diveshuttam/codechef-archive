Each of these wheels contain the digits from 0 to 9 in a circular way. That is, 0 is followed by 1, 1 by 2 and so on 8 by 9 and 9 by 0 again. Initially all the wheels of the number lock are showing 0.</p>\n<p>Jay is just casually playing around with this lock. He sometimes moves all the wheels numbered from <b>L</b> to <b>R</b> (<b>L</b> <= <b>R</b>, both inclusive) by one step. That is the displayed number changes to the next number on the wheel. For example, if it showed 0 it changes to 1, in case of 5 it changes to 6 and in case of 9 it changes to 0 again.<p>\n<p>Seikatsu loves challenging Jay at unexpected timings. She suddenly asks him to sum up all the displayed digits on wheels numbered from <b>L</b> to <b>R</b>. Jay doesn't like losing challenges and wants to reply to her as soon as possible. Can you help him to answer her queries?</p>\n<p>There are 2 types of operations:<br>\nType 1: Where Jay has moved all the wheels from <b>L</b> to <b>R</b> by one step each.<br>\nType 2: Seikatsu challenges Jay to find the sum of all the digits displayed on wheels numbered from <b>L</b> to <b>R</b>.</p>\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The first line of input contains two integers, <b>N</b> and <b>Q</b>. <b>N</b> denotes the number of wheels and <b>Q</b> denotes the number of operations on these wheels.<br>\nThe next <b>Q</b> lines contain 3 integers: <b>type</b>, <b>L</b> and <b>R</b> each. <b>type</b> denotes the type of the operation mentioned above. <b>L</b> and <b>R</b> denote the values corresponding to these operations.</p>\n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>For each operation of type 2, print the sum on a separate line.</p>\n\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b>1</b> <= <b>N</b>, <b>Q</b> <= <b>10^5</b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> <= <b>L</b> <= <b>R</b> <= <b>N</b></li>\n<li><b>type</b> = <b>1</b> or <b>2</b></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n5 6\n2 2 2\n1 4 5\n2 1 5\n1 1 2\n2 3 5\n1 2 4\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n0\n2\n2\n</pre>\n\n<h3>Explanation:</h3>\n<pre>\nInitial lock pattern: 0 0 0 0 0\nOperation 1: 0\nOperation 2: Lock pattern, 0 0 0 1 1\nOperation 3: 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 1 = 2\nOperation 4: Lock pattern, 1 1 0 1 1\nOperation 5: 0 + 1 + 1 = 2\n</pre>",
