You have to travel through the matrix from (1, 1) to (N, M) and the only moves allowed from a cell (x, y) are (x + 1, y) or (x, y + 1).\n\n<br /> <br />\n\nSounds easy right !!\n\n<br /> <br />\n\nWell, to make it lil more challenging, Asya has kept <b>D</b> disks on some cells of the matrix. She has given you a list of coordinates of the cells which have a disk on them. She has given you the following information about the disks:\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>One cell can have at max one disk.</li>\n\t<li>If you reach a cell which has a disk, you have to take the disk, you can't leave it there.</li>\n\t<li>The <b>radius</b> of the i-th disk is <b>(D - i + 1)</b>. For example if list has 3 disks, the radii of the disks are 3, 2 and 1 respectively.</li>\n\t<li>As you move through the matrix and pick up disks, you have to keep making a pile of disks, and to keep it stable, you have to keep the disks in ascending order of radius from top.</li>\n\t<li>You can't insert a disk at bottom or in between the disks you already have in pile, you have to insert the new disk at the top only.</li>\n</ul> \n\n<br /> <br />\n\nFollowing these rules, she has asked you to find the number of ways to reach <b>(N, M)</b> with exactly <b>X</b> number of disks in your pile. You have to print the answer for every X from 0 to D inclusive.\n\n<br /> <br />\n\nAs the answer can be very large, print the answer modulo <b>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</b>\n\n</p>\n\n<h3>Input : </h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The first line of the input contains an integer <b>T</b> denoting the number of test cases. The description of <b>T</b> test cases follows.</li>\n<li>The first line of each test case contains a two integers <b>N</b>, <b>M</b> denoting the size of matrix.\n<li>The second line of each test case contains a single integers  <b>D</b>, denoting the number of disks in the matrix.</li>\n<li>Two lines follow with D integers each, denoting rows of all the disks and columns of all the disks present in the matrix, respectively.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3>Output : </h3>\n<ul>\n<li>For each test case, output a single line containing <b>D + 1</b> integers, where i-th integer is the number of ways to reach <b>(N, M)</b> from <b>(1,1)</b> with exactly <b>i</b> number of disks in pile. (i ranges from <b>0 to D</b> inclusive).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3>Constraints : </h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>T</b> \u2264 <b>5</b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>N, M</b> \u2264 <b>10<sup>5</sup></b></li>\n<li><b>0</b> \u2264 <b>D</b> \u2264 <b>10<sup>2</sup></b></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n1\n3 3 \n3\n1 1 1\n1 2 3\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n0 3 2 1\n</pre>\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n",
