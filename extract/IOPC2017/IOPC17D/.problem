If he has 3 gifts to be distributed in town 1, he can distribute it in 3 ways: (1 gift to 3 different kids), (2 gifts to one kid and one gift to another kid) or (all 3 gifts to 1 kid).\nFor a town, two distributions are considered different if there exists at least one positive k such that number of kids receiving k gifts is different in both the distributions.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nSanta now wants to know the number of ways in which he can distribute the gifts. For the country, two distributions are different if there exists any town for which the distribution is different in both the distributions.</p>\n\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The first line of the input contains <b>T</b>, the number of testcases.</p>\n<p>The ith of the following <b>T</b> lines contains two integers, <b>N</b> and <b>M</b> respectively.</p>\n\n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>On the ith line, output the number of ways modulo 1000000007</p>\n\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>1 <= <b>T</b> <= 1,00,000</li>\n<li>1 <= <b>N</b> <= 12,500</li>\n<li> 1 <= <b>M</b> \n<li>The number of gifts for any town would also be <= 12,500</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n2\n1 1\n3 1\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n1\n6\n</pre>\n\n<h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p>Number of ways to distribute 1 gift = 1</p>\n<p>Number of ways to distribute 2 gifts = 2 [ 2 , (1+1)]</p>\n<p>Number of ways to distribute 3 gifts = 3 [ 3 , 2+1 , 1+1+1 ]</p>\n<p>So, for the first testcase, there is only 1 way to distribute it. But for the second testcase, there are 1*2*3 = 6 ways.</p>",
