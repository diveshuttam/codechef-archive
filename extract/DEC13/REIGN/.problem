They have seen a lot: prosperity and hunger, tranquility and rebellions, live and death. But nevertheless, they still hold the throne.</p>\n<p>King Joffrey Baratheon's reign is running now. As a wise man, he honors the history of his family. So, he commanded to build up <b>two</b> monuments, that will remind about some historical periods of the Baratheons.</p>\n<p>Formally, the Baratheons have been ruling for <b>N</b> years. Every year is described by an integer <b>A<sub>i</sub></b>, the level of prosperity in <b>i</b>-th year. If <b>i</b>-th year was a great year, then <b>A<sub>i</sub></b> might be a positive integer. Otherwise, if <b>i</b>-th year was a horrible year, then <b>A<sub>i</sub></b> might be a negative integer.</p>\n<p>Each historical period can be described as two integers <b>S</b> and <b>F</b>, the start and the finish of the period respectively. Of course, <b>S</b> is not greater than <b>F</b> for each period, that we consider in this task.</p>\n<p>You are to pick two historical periods, but there are some rules:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Two periods shouldn't have common years. I.e. a period [1, 5] has no common years with a period [6, 7];</li>\n<li>The first period should start earlier than the second one. I.e. a period [1, 5] starts earlier than [6, 7];</li>\n<li>Two periods shouldn't be too close to each other. There must be at least <b>K</b> years between the finish of the first period and the start of the second period. I.e. periods [1, 5] and [10, 10] can be chosen in case <b>K</b> equals to 4, while they can't in case <b>K</b> equals to 5.</li>\n<li>The sum of the levels of prosperity in chosen years should be as big as possible.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Afterwards, you should report the sum of the levels of prosperity in chosen years to your King. Make everything right, otherwise King Joffrey won't be merciful!</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The first line of the input contains an integer <b>T</b> denoting the number of test cases. The description of <b>T</b> test cases follows.<br /><br />\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers <b>N</b> and <b>K</b> denoting the length of the Baratheons' reign and the minimal amount of years between two chosen periods.<br /><br />\nThe second line contains <b>N</b> space-separated integers <b>A<sub>1</sub></b>, <b>A<sub>2</sub></b>, ..., <b>A<sub>N</sub></b> denoting the levels of prosperity in corresponding years.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>For each test case, output a single line containing the required integer.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>1 \u2264 <b>T</b> \u2264 5;</li>\n<li>2 \u2264 <b>N</b> \u2264 10<sup>5</sup>;</li>\n<li>0 \u2264 <b>K</b> \u2264 10<sup>5</sup>;</li>\n<li>-10<sup>9</sup> \u2264 <b>A<sub>i</sub></b> \u2264 10<sup>9</sup> for every 1 \u2264 <b>i</b> \u2264 <b>N</b>;</li>\n<li><b>K</b> + 2 \u2264 <b>N</b></li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n3\n5 3\n-1 1 2 3 -1\n8 3\n5 5 -1 -2 3 -1 2 -2\n6 0\n5 -1 5 0 -1 9\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n-2\n12\n18\n</pre><p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p>There are <b>T</b> = 3 test cases the input.</p>\n<p>The first test case: <b>N</b> equals to 5, <b>K</b> equals to 3, A[] equals to {-1, 1, 2, 3, -1}. There is the only option: we have to choose [1, 1] and [5, 5] periods.</p>\n<p>The second test case: <b>N</b> equals to 8, <b>K</b> equals to 3, A[] equals to {5, 5, -1, -2, 3, -1, 2, -2}. It is optimal to choose [1, 2] and [7, 7] periods. That is the only optimal choice that you can make.</p>\n<p>The second test case: <b>N</b> equals to 6, <b>K</b> equals to 0, A[] equals to {5, -1, 5, 0, -1, 9}. It is optimal to choose [1, 3] and [6, 6] periods. But that is not the only optimal choice that you can make.</p>\n",
