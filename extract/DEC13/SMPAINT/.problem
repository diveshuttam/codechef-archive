    "body": "<span class=\"solution-visible-txt\">All submissions for this problem are available.</span><h3> Read problems statements in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.codechef.com/download/translated/DEC13/mandarin/SMPAINT.pdf\">Mandarin Chinese </a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.codechef.com/download/translated/DEC13/russian/SMPAINT.pdf\">Russian</a>.</h3>\n\n<p>Being a CS student, Ron really don't understand why he has to take a compulsory course called \"Art in Digital Age\".<br />\nThe objective of this course from what his school said is to help the CS students release the stress by doing something new other from coding/programming. The problem is Ron really love coding and he doesn't care about other stuff. This course even gives him<br />\nmore stress. However, like it or not Ron still need to try his best not to let this course ruins his great GPA.<br />\nCan you help him with his first assignment which is described below.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn this assignment, Ron is given an <b>N</b>\u00d7<b>N</b> pixels image called sample image. Ron is required to create a copy of the<br />\nsample image using an simple graphic painting program called SMPaint. Only two types of operation can be used in SMPaint:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Init: Make the new image with the specific size, all the pixels of the new image are white.</li>\n<li>Paint: User gives 5 integers <b>C</b>, <b>U</b>, <b>D</b>, <b>L</b>, <b>R</b> and SMPaint will change colour to <b>C</b> at all the pixels (<b>x</b>, <b>y</b>) such that (<b>U</b> \u2264 <b>x</b> \u2264 <b>D</b> and <b>L</b> \u2264 <b>y</b> \u2264 <b>R</b>).<br />\nThe pixel (<b>x</b>, <b>y</b>) is the pixel at the <b>xth</b> row (from the top, 1-indexed) and the <b>yth</b> column (from the left side, 1-indexed).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://tinypic.com?ref=33wa5wo\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://i40.tinypic.com/33wa5wo.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Image and video hosting by TinyPic\" /></a></p>\n<p>\nWe can see that the Paint operation actually is painting a specific rectangle in the image by one specific colour.<br />\nThe image in the <b>figure 1</b> can be drawn using 3 calls of the second function if we paint the red rectangle first and then paint two<br />\ngreen rectangles. Notice that if a pixel is changed colour several time, it final colour is corresponding to the last time it is painted.<br />\nThis help us save some calls of the second function. For the image in figure 1 we can paint a large green rectangle first and then paint the red rectangle.<br />\nYour mission is help Ron finish the assignment with using as least as possible number of calls of the second function.\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The first line of the input contains integer <b>N</b>. Each of the next <b>N</b> lines contains <b>N</b> integers. The <b>yth</b> number in the <b>xth</b> line<br />\nrepresent the colour of the pixel (<b>x</b>, <b>y</b>) in the sample image.\n</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>The first line of the output must contain integer <b>M</b> that is the number of calls of the second function you need.<br />\nThe next <b>M</b> lines represent the calls to the second function in chronological order.<br />\nEach line must contain 5 integers which are the values (they must be in this order) <b>C</b>, <b>U</b>, <b>D</b>, <b>L</b>, <b>R</b> for the corresponding call. The following conditions must be held:<br />\n<lu></lu></p>\n<li><b>0</b> \u2264 <b>C</b> \u2264 <b>100</b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>U</b> \u2264 <b>D</b> \u2264 <b>N</b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>L</b> \u2264 <b>R</b> \u2264 <b>N</b></li>\n<p>\n</p>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>N</b> \u2264 <b>1000</b></li>\n<li>The colours are represented by integers from <b>0</b> to <b>100</b> where <b>0</b> means white colour.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre>\n<b>Input:</b>\n5\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 1 2 1 0\n0 1 2 1 0\n0 1 2 1 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n2\n1 2 4 2 4\n2 2 4 3 3\n</pre><p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3> Scoring &amp; the test data generation </h3>\n<p>\nYour solution will not get point if it performs more than <b>N<sup>2</sup></b> Paint operations or the final image is different<br />\nwith the sample one. Your solution will be marked as Wrong Answer for that two cases.<br /></p>\n<p>If the number of Paint operations does not exceed <b>N<sup>2</sup></b> and the final image is the same as the sample one<br />\nyou will get the score which is equal to the number of Paint operations. Smaller score means your solution is better. <br /> <br /></p>\n<p>The test data is generated randomly by simulating the process of making an image in SMPaint using no more than <b>500</b> Paint operations. But please note that, the value of <b>N</b> is picked manually. <br /> <br /></p>\n<p>We have 25 official test files. You must correctly solve all test files to receive OK.<br />\nDuring the contest, your overall score is the sum of the scores on the first 7 test files.<br />\nAfter the contest, all solutions will be rescored by the sum of the scores on the rest 18 test files.<br />\nNote, that public part of the tests can not contain some border cases. For example, we should say that<br />\nin all public tests <b>10 \u2264 N</b> holds.\n</p>\n",
