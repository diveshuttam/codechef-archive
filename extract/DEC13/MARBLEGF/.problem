She immediately requested her mom to give her the new marbles, but, her mom had some tricks kept up her sleeve:</p>\n<p>Mom: \"Not so fast, young girl!! These won't come for free! If you want to keep playing with them, you must prove you deserve them!!\"</p>\n<p>Lira: *<b>moans</b>* \"Alright, mom, what do I have to do now?\"</p>\n<p>(Yes, Lira's mom can be quite annoying)</p>\n<p>Mom: \"Well, you can assume that I have an array A of size <b>N</b> , where <b>N</b> is the total number of students I will give marbles to, and A[i] is the number of marbles each student initially has.\"</p>\n<p>Lira: *<b>smiles slightly</b>* \"So you're feeling generous hum?\"</p>\n<p>Mom: \"Well, not too generous... imagine I wanted to give more marbles to some of your school friends who do well on their exams, or, on the other hand take away some marbles from the greedier friends.\"</p>\n<p>Lira: \"Mom, c'mon that's too easy!!\"</p>\n<p>Mom: \"Alright, so given a group of students, starting on student <b>i</b> and ending on student <b>j</b>, I want to know how many marbles they have together!\"</p>\n<p>Well, it turns out that Lira actually did solve this problem and she did it very efficiently!!</p>\n<p>It's now your turn to solve the problem that Lira already did in a brilliant way!</p>\n<h3>Formal description:</h3>\n<p>Lira is given array <b>A</b>, which contains elements between 1000 and 2000.</p>\n<p>Three types of queries can be performed on this array: add a given value to a single element on it, subtract a given value from a single element on it and find the sum of the values between indexes i and j, i.e. A[i]+...+A[j]. Check input and example section for details.</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The first line of the input contains two integers: <b>N</b> and <b>Q</b>, denoting respectively, the number of students that there are present to receive the marbles as a gift and the number of actions Lira's mom will perform.</p>\n<p>These actions can be of three different types:</p>\n<li><b>S i j</b> - if the mom wants to find the sum of the number of marbles from students i to j.</li>\n<li><b>G i num_marbles</b> - if the mom decides to give num_marbles to student i</li>\n<li><b>T i num_marbles</b> - if the mom decides to take away num_marbles from student i</li>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>The output should contain as many lines as the number of queries S and it should contain the answer for each query on a separate line</p>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b>2</b> \u2264 <b>N</b> \u2264 <b>1000000</b></li>\n<li><b>3</b> \u2264 <b>Q</b> \u2264 <b>50000</b></li>\n<li><b>The array is 0-indexed.</b></li>\n<li><b>1000</b> \u2264 <b>A[i]</b> \u2264 <b>2000</b></li>\n<li><b>A student can never have a negative value of marbles. (i.e. there's no data which can cause a student to have a negative value of marbles)</b></li>\n<li><b>0</b> \u2264 <b>i, j</b> \u2264 <b>N-1</b>, and <b>i</b> \u2264 <b>j</b> for the sum query</li>\n<li><b>At any given time, it is assured that the maximum number of marbles each student can have (<b>num_marbles</b>) never exceeds the size of the int data type.</b></li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n<p>5 3\n1000 1002 1003 1004 1005\nS 0 2\nG 0 3\nS 0 2\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n3005\n3008\n</p></pre>",
