This software has to simulate the following shuffling process. A stack of N cards is placed face down on the table. Cards in the stack are ordered by value. Topmost card has value 1 and the one on the bottom has value N. To shuffle the cards we repeat the following steps M times:\n<ol>\n<li>take A cards from the top of the deck.</li>\n<li>take another B cards from the top of the deck.</li>\n<li>put the A cards, which you removed in the first step, back on top of the remaining deck.</li>\n<li>take C cards from the deck</li>\n<li>put the B cards, which you're still holding from the second move, <b>card by card</b> on top of the deck.</li>\n<li>finally, return the block of C cards on top</li>\n</ol>\nNote: taking a block of cards from the top of the deck does not change their order. The entire block is removed in a single move and not card by card. The only exception is the fifth move, where you return cards one by one from the top.\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n</p><p>The first line contains integers N and M. The following M lines describe the moves by integers A<sub>i</sub>, B<sub>i</sub>, C<sub>i</sub> as described in the previous section.\n</p><p>In the spirit of random card shuffling, all test cases were generated with uniform random distributions to select where to cut the deck of cards.\n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n</p><p>In a single line output the cards in the deck after performing all the moves. Cards should be listed from top of the deck to bottom and separated by spaces.\n\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>1 &lt;= N, M &lt;= 100 000</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Example</h3>\n\n<pre>\n<b>Input:</b>\n10 2\n6 2 2\n5 3 6\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n1 2 8 7 3 9 6 5 4 10\n</pre></p>",
