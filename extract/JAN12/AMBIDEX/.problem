    "body": "<span class=\"solution-visible-txt\">All submissions for this problem are available.</span><p>\nA recent spike in demand for competent chefs has caused the emergence of a highly specialized training program,\nin which chefs are trained to use 2 tools simultaneously (one in each hand).\nThese chefs, called \"ambidextrous chefs\", can theoretically perform the same work as 2 ordinary chefs.\nThe problem with these ambidextrous chefs is that their training is so specific that they cannot use any\ntools except for the 2 tools they can use simultaneously.\n</p>\n<p>\nHead Chef wants to form chef teams of ambidextrous chefs.\nIn order to form a complete team, for every tool present there must be at least one chef capable of operating it.\nChef wants to create as many teams as possible, but at the same time hire as few chefs as possible.  See the scoring section for details.\n</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>Input begins with an integer T, the number of test cases.\nEach test case begins with 2 integers N and M.\nN is the number of different tools, and M the number of ambidextrous chefs.\n2 lines follow with exactly M integers each, each between 1 and N.\nThe i-th integer of each line indicates a tool that the i-th chef can use.\nIt is guaranteed that the i-th integer of the first line will be different from the i-th integer of the second line.\nIt is further guaranteed that each tool will be usable by at least one chef.\n</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>For each test case, output M integers on a line, one per ambidextrous chef.\nThe number should be 0 if the chef should not be hired.\nOtherwise, the number should be any positive number not exceeding 10000 to indicate the team to which that chef should be assigned.\nChefs with the same team number will be assigned to the same team.\n</p>\n<h3>Scoring</h3>\n<p>\nYour score for each test case is (C*N-H)/M, where C is the number of complete chef teams formed, N is the number of tools, H is the total number of chefs hired, and M is the total number of chefs.\nIf this value is non-positive for any test case, the submission will be judged \"Wrong Answer\" instead.\nYour score for each test file is the average of the scores for the individual test cases.\nYour overall score is the average of your scores on the individual test files.\nNote that optimal solutions are not required, but better solutions will earn more points.\n</p>\n\n<h3>Sample Input</h3>\n<pre>2\n5 9\n5 1 5 5 1 3 4 4 1\n3 2 2 3 5 1 2 2 4\n8 12\n6 6 8 7 1 1 6 5 3 8 7 6\n2 8 1 5 8 2 7 7 1 3 4 4\n</pre>\n\n<h3>Sample Output</h3>\n<pre>2 2 1 3 3 1 3 2 1\n2 0 1 1 2 1 0 2 2 1 2 1\n\n</pre>\n<p>The score for the first test case is (3*5-9)/9 = 0.666667,\nand the score for the second test case is (2*8-10)/12 = 0.5.\nHence the overall score is 0.583333.\n</p>\n\n<h3>Test case generation</h3>\n<p>\nFor each official test file, T is 10.  For each test case, N is chosen\nrandomly between 10 and 100, inclusive, and M between 200 and 1000,\ninclusive.  Then ceiling(2*M/(N-1)) of each type of tool is placed in\na sack, and one by one each of the chefs will randomly remove 2\ndifferent tools from the sack.  If after all chefs have selected tools\nthere is a tool that none of the chefs selected, the process is\nrestarted with the same values of N and M.\n</p>",
