As we all know, Chef likes to code a lot, and his friend MoChef also likes to code. Both the Chefs always challenge each other by giving each other tough puzzles to be solved during their lab sessions. \n\nSo one fine day, MoChef decided to convert their electronics wave compression problem into a puzzle for Chef. MoChef tells that, there is a **wave of alphabets (a to z, all lowercase)**, which needs to be compressed.  MoChef tells that there are two parameters to that wave i.e. **D**, which is number of alphabets in a wave and **N**, number of times that wave is repeated. \n\nChef knows that the sequence of alphabets always starts from to a to z. \nFor each wave, there is a set of alphabets which needs to be removed from the original wave so that the wave can be compressed. Chef's task is to find the final wave for given **N** after compressing as required.\n\n###Input:\n\n- First line will contain *T*, number of testcases.\n- Each testcase starts with single line of input with 2 integers denoting D and N.\n- Next line contains a string S with unique characters.\n\n###Output:\nFor each testcase, output in a single line how the final wave looks like after compression and repeating N times.\n\n###Constraints \n- $1 \\leq T \\leq 1000$\n- $1 \\leq D \\leq 25$. D is an odd number.\n- $1 \\leq N \\leq 1000$\n- $1 \\leq |set(S)| \\leq 26$\n\n###Sample Input:\n    2\n    7 3\n    clda\n    7 4\n    clde\n\n###Sample Output:\n    befgbefgbefg\n    abfgabfgabfgabfg\n\t\n###EXPLANATION:\n**Case 1**:\n  First wave contains abcdefg as its characters. After removing, a,d,c from it we get befg x 3.\n\n",
