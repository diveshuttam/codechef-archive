Everything was fine, but then the game came into the real world because of a horrible mistake of one of the players. Now the whole world is in danger! The world can be described as the Cartesian plane where each point has two real coordinates <b>x</b> and <b>y</b>. In order to save the world you are to complete the following task.</p>\n<h3>Task</h3>\n<p>Suppose you are given an angle which measures exactly <b>N</b> degrees, where <b>N</b> is an integer with 0\u00a0&lt;\u00a0<b>N</b>\u00a0&lt;\u00a0360.</p>\n<p>You are to answer the question: is it possible to construct, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compass-and-straightedge_construction\">using only a straightedge and compass</a>, <b>N-1</b> rays which divide this angle into <b>N</b> equal angles of size 1 degree?</p>\n<p>If the answer is <b>YES</b>, you must demonstrate this by listing the steps you would take to generate these rays.</p>\n<h3>Instructions</h3>\n<p>You will be given three points: <b>V</b>, <b>R<sub>1</sub></b>, and <b>R<sub>2</sub></b>. The angle you are to consider is the clockwise angle from the ray <b>VR<sub>1</sub></b> to the ray <b>VR<sub>2</sub></b>. This angle, in degrees, will always be an integer <b>N</b> with 0 &lt; <b>N</b> &lt; 360.</p>\n<p>If the above construction is possible, you are able to perform two types of operations:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Construct a line that connects two known points <b>A</b> and <b>B</b>.</li>\n<li>Construct a circle with center at a known point <b>C</b>, and radius equal to the distance between two known points <b>A</b> and <b>B</b>.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>A point <b>P</b> is called <em>known</em> if it satisfies one of these two statements:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>P</b> is equal to one of <b>V</b>, <b>R<sub>1</sub></b>, or <b>R<sub>2</sub></b>.</li>\n<li><b>P</b> is one of the points of intersection of any lines or circles constructed in previous steps.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The construction is complete once you have found <b>N-1</b> known points: <b>D<sub>1</sub></b>, <b>D<sub>2</sub></b>, ..., <b>D<sub>N-1</sub></b>, such that the rays <b>VD<sub>1</sub></b>, <b>VD<sub>2</sub></b>, ..., <b>VD<sub>N-1</sub></b>, divide the given angle into <b>N</b> equal angles of size 1 degree.</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The first line of the input files contains two space-separated real numbers with precision at least 1e-6: the <b>x</b> and <b>y</b> coordinates of <b>V</b>. The second and third lines contain the coordinates of <b>R<sub>1</sub></b> and <b>R<sub>2</sub></b> similarly.</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>The first line of the output should contain a single word: <b>YES</b> or <b>NO</b> - whether it is theoretically possible to perform the construction described above with a straightedge and compass only.</p>\n<p>If your answer is <b>NO</b>, do not output anything else.</p>\n<p>If your answer is <b>YES</b>, the following lines should describe your operations, one per line, as follows.</p>\n<p>If you want to construct a line between known points <b>A</b> and <b>B</b>, output the word <b>Line</b> followed by 4 space-separated numbers - the coordinates of <b>A</b>, followed by the coordinates of <b>B</b>. <b>A</b> and <b>B</b> must not be the same point.</p>\n<p>If you want to construct a circle with center at the known point <b>C</b>, and radius equal to the distance between known points <b>A</b> and <b>B</b>, output the word <b>Circle</b> followed by 6 space-separated numbers - the coordinates of <b>C</b>, followed by the coordinates of <b>A</b> and <b>B</b>. <b>A</b> and <b>B</b> must not be the same point, but there are no such restrictions on <b>C</b>.</p>\n<p>Once you have performed all necessary operations, output a single line with the word <b>Answer</b>. In each of the next <b>N-1</b> lines, output two space-separated numbers - the coordinates of <b>D<sub>1</sub></b>, <b>D<sub>2</sub></b>, ..., <b>D<sub>N-1</sub></b>, listed in clockwise order. Each of these must be known points.</p>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<p>The absolute value of any coordinate given in the input does not exceed <b>1000</b>.</p>\n<p>All input coordinates have a precision of at least <b>1e-6</b>. Prior to precision adjustments, the clockwise angle formed by the input points, in degrees, is guaranteed to be an integer <b>N</b> with 0 &lt; <b>N</b> &lt; 360.</p>\n<p>All coordinates in the output are compared for equality with precision <b>1e-5</b>. This means that you can use point <b>H</b> as a known point if there is a true known point <b>K</b> with <b>|H<sub>x</sub>-K<sub>x</sub>|</b> and <b>|H<sub>y</sub>-K<sub>y</sub>|</b> no more than <b>1e-5</b> each.</p>\n<p>Your solution must not output more than <b>1000</b> operations.</p>\n<h3>Subtasks</h3>\n<ul>\n<b>Subtask #1 </b> [25 points]: <b>N</b> \u2264 <b>4</b>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<b>Subtask #2</b> [75 points]: maximum constraints\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n-679.6073275406 -315.6362656580\n-844.0655568007 -298.0169842162\n-841.1364219780 -292.6039079355\n\n<b>Output:</b>\nYES\nLine -679.6073275406 -315.6362656580 -844.0655568007 -298.0169842162\nLine -679.6073275406 -315.6362656580 -841.1364219780 -292.6039079355\nCircle -679.6073275406 -315.6362656580 -679.6073275406 -315.6362656580 -844.0655\n568007 -298.0169842162\nLine -679.6073275406 -315.6362656580 -841.1364219780 -292.6039079355\nLine -844.0655568007 -298.0169842162 -843.3504692364 -292.2882079766\nCircle -844.0655568007 -298.0169842162 -844.0655568007 -298.0169842162 -843.3504\n692364 -292.2882079766\nCircle -843.3504692364 -292.2882079766 -844.0655568007 -298.0169842162 -843.3504\n692364 -292.2882079766\nLine -848.6692787746 -294.5333120998 -838.7467472625 -295.7718800931\nAnswer\n-843.7080130185 -295.1525960964</pre>\n<p><em>There are other acceptable solutions.</em></p>\n<p><em>The line breaks inside the second to last coordinates for each circle are for website display reasons only, and should not exist in your output.</em></p>\n<h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p>The measure of the given angle is 2 degrees. It is well known that we can bisect <em>any</em> angle with a compass and straightedge, so we can certainly do so for a 2 degree angle. This divides the angle into two 1-degree angles as required. The method presented is one way of doing so and looks like this:</p>\n<p><img src=\"/download/extimages/18803cb00817e914893a22e99f054829.png\" /></p>\n",
