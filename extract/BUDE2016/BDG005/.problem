She eats lots of them every day. But due to excessive chocolate-eating, her doctor advised to restrict the intake of chocolate. But as she is addicted to chocolate, she cannot control it suddenly. So, she decides to play a game for quitting chocolate.<br /><br />\nOn each day, if the number of chocolates is even, she will eat half of the chocolates. If it is odd, she brings more chocolates such that the new number of chocolates is <b>thrice the current number of chocolates plus three</b>. If the number of chocolates left is 1 on any day, then Mimi will leave eating chocolate permanently.<br /></p>\n<p>\nWill Mimi be still eating chocolate on 29th January, 2113?\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p><ul>\n<li>The first line contains an integer <b>T,</b> the number of test cases. <b>T</b> test cases follow.</li>\n<li>Each test case, contain an integer <b>N</b>, the number of chocolates.</li>\n</ul>\n</p><p><br /></p>\n<h3>Rules</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Bugs will be mainly logical errors, including overflow issues.
