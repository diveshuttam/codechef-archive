He is always interested in solving and setting problems on primes. His brother Sanju has been given the responsibility of setting the problems for ITRIX Online Programming Contest. Sanju decides to set a problem on math for which he asked Ram to help him. If Ram gave a problem which impresses Sanju, Sanju will present him a gift. Ram loves gifts too. Ram also knows that Sanju loves arrays. So, he decided to create a problem using arrays and primes.<br /><br /></p>\n<p>Ram introduces a new term called \"Prime frequency\". Prime frequency of a number is defined as the amount of contribution of prime numbers to that number. For example:<br />\n<br /><br /><br />\ni) 2<br /><br />\nPrime frequency of '2' is 1.<br />\n<br /><br /><br />\nii) 14<br /><br />\n14 can be expressed as 2 * 7. Prime frequency of '14' is 2.<br />\n<br /><br /><br />\niii) 30<br /><br />\n30 can be expressed as 2 * 3 * 5. Prime frequency of '30' is 3.<br />\n<br /><br /><br />\n<b>Note:</b> Prime frequency of '1' is 0.<br />\n<br /><br /><br />\nProduct of an array is the product of all the numbers in the array. <br /><br />\nPrime frequency of an array is defined as the prime frequency of the product of the array.<br />\n<br /><br /><br />\nEx: Array {2, 3, 5}<br /><br />\nProduct of the array = 2 * 3 * 5 = 30<br /><br />\nPrime frequency of the array = Prime frequency of 30 = 3<br /><br /></p>\n<p>Now the question which Ram puts forth is \"Given an array, find the prime frequency of it.\"</p>\n<h3><b>Input</b></h3>\n<p>\nThe first line consists of 't', the number of test cases.<br /><br />\nThe first line of each testcase consists of 'n', the number of elements in the array.<br /><br />\nThe second line of each testcase consists of the elements of the array.<br />\n</p>\n<h3><b>Constraints</b></h3>\n<p>\n1 &lt;= t &lt;= 500<br /><br />\n1 &lt;= n &lt;= 10^6<br /><br />\n1 &lt;= a[i] &lt;= 10^5<br />\n</p>\n<h3><b>Output</b></h3>\n<p>\nFor each testcase, output a single line containing the required answer.<br />\n</p>\n<h3><b>Example</b></h3>\n<pre>\n<b>Input:</b>\n\n2\n3\n2 3 5\n4\n2 4 6 8\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n\n3\n8\n</pre>",
