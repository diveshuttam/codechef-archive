You are the overall coordinator of the fest. It is your duty to select the teams representing your college. Students of first and second years only are allowed. A team can have atmost 2 members. The HOD has given you an instruction that, in a team of 2, there must be one 1st year student and one 2nd year student and not two 1st year students or two 2nd year students. You are given 'n' students from each year. The students vary in IQ, i.e., some may have more IQ and some may have less IQ. Now, you have to count the number of teams whose total IQ level is exactly equal to 'k'. <br /><br /></p>\n<p><b>Note:</b> This is just an informal counting and so it is allowed that a student can be in more than 1 team.\n</p>\n<h3><b>Input</b></h3>\n<p>\nThe first line consists of 't', the number of test cases.<br />\n<br /><br /><br />\nThe first line of each test case consists of 'n' and 'k', the number of students from each year and the expected IQ level </p>\n<p>of a team respectively.<br />\n<br /><br /><br />\nTwo lines follow each containing 'n' integers. The first line being the IQ of 1st year students and the second line being </p>\n<p>the IQ of 2nd year students.\n</p>\n<h3><b>Output</b></h3>\n<p>\nFor each test case, output the number of teams whose total IQ level is exactly 'k'.\n</p>\n<h3><b>Constraints</b></h3>\n<p>\n1 &lt;= t &lt;= 500<br /><br />\n1 &lt;= n &lt;= 10^5<br /><br />\n0 &lt;= a[i],b[i] &lt;= 1000<br /><br />\n0 &lt;= k &lt;= 10^3\n</p>\n<h3><b>Example</b></h3>\n<pre>\n<b>Input</b>\n\n1\n3 5\n1 2 4\n1 3 4\n\n<b>Output</b>\n\n3\n</pre><h3><b>Explanation</b></h3>\n<p>\nThe teams are {1,4}, {2,3} and {4,1}.\n</p>\n",
