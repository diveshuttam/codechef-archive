He is very eager to know its applications in real time as well as in programming. Sanju asked his father Santhosh who was a great programmer in his time. Hearing the word Merge sort, the thing which immediately came through Santhosh's mind is \"Inversions\". An inversion in an array is defined as follows:<br /><br /></p>\n<p>If a[i] > a[j], for any i &lt; j, then the pair (i, j) is an inversion.<br /><br />\nInversion of an array is the number of distinct pairs (i, j) such that a[i] > a[j] and i &lt; j.<br /><br />\nTwo pairs (i1, j1) &amp; (i2, j2) are said to be distinct if (i1 != i2) or (j1 != j2).<br /><br /></p>\n<p>Sanju redefines the meaning of an inversion as follows:<br /><br /></p>\n<p>If a[i] >= a[j], for any i &lt; j, then the pair (i, j) is an inversion.<br /><br /></p>\n<p>Now Sanju has a question for you. Given an array 'A', find the maximum number of inversions possible in the array. He permits you to use the following operations on the array:<br /><br /></p>\n<p>i) Swap any two elements of the array.<br /><br />\nii) Rotate the array by 'k' integers ('k' is any arbitrary number >= 0).<br /><br /></p>\n<p>You are allowed to do both the above operations as many times as possible.\n</p>\n<h3><b>Input</b></h3>\n<p>\nThe first line consists of 't', the number of test cases.<br /><br />\nThe first line of each test case consists of 'n', the number of elements in the array.<br /><br />\nThe second line of each test case consists of the elements of the array.<br />\n</p>\n<h3><b>Constraints</b></h3>\n<p>\n1 &lt;= t &lt;= 100<br /><br />\n1 &lt;= n &lt;= 10^5<br /><br />\n1 &lt;= a[i] &lt;= 10^9<br />\n</p>\n<h3><b>Output</b></h3>\n<p>\nFor each test case, output a single line containing the maximum number of inversions possible in the array.\n</p>\n<h3><b>Example</b></h3>\n<pre>\n<b>Input</b>\n\n1\n3\n1 3 2\n\n<b>Output</b>\n\n3\n</pre><h3><b>Explanation</b></h3>\n<p>Rotating the array to the right by 2 integers yields us the maximum number of inversions possible in the given array.</p>\n",
