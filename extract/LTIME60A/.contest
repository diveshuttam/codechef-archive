At CodeChef, we work hard to revive the geek in you by hosting a programming contest at the start of the month and another smaller programming challenge in the middle of the month.</p>\r\n<h4>About CodeChef May Lunchtime 2018:</h4>\r\n<p class=\"last\">CodeChef Lunchtime is a three hours coding contest where you can show off your computer programming skills.</p>\r\n<h4>Contest Details:</h4>\r\n<ul class=\"last\">\r\n<li><b>Duration: </b> 3 hours</li>\r\n<li><b>Start Date: </b> Saturday, 26th May, 2018 at 19:30 HRS (IST)</li>\r\n<li><b>End Date: </b> Saturday, 26th May, 2018\u00a0at 22:30 HRS (IST)</li>\r\n<li>Check your timezone <a href=\"https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=May+Lunchtime+2018&amp;iso=20180526T1930&amp;p1=44&amp;ah=3\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>Eligibility Criteria: Anyone with a knack for Programming :P</h4>\r\n<p class=\"last\">Our contests are open to all the programmers across the globe.</p>\r\n<h4>What's in it for you?</h4>\r\n<p>The idea behind these programming contests is that we want you to learn while competing. Also we believe that it is alright to refer to tutorials, books and other materials, learn a concept and then apply the same to solve a problem during a contest. But it is <b>not alright to copy other people's solutions or seek other people's help to solve a problem without understanding it.</b> The dividing line may seem to be thin but it can be captured by the spirit of learning. If whatever you are doing is making you learn while you do so, we tend to believe that it is alright. However, all the participants are expected to abide to <a href=\"http://discuss.codechef.com/questions/18662/does-codechef-have-any-code-of-conduct\" class=\"button blue\">CodeChef Code Of Conduct</a></p>\r\n<p>Not just that, as a token of motivation we also give away goodies to the winners of the contest. You can know more about prizes <a href=\"http://discuss.codechef.com/questions/51999/how-do-i-win-a-codechef-goodie\">here</a>. However, our sole intention lies in making our users learn new concepts while competing.</p>\r\n<p><b>For Indians:</b></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Top 10 school students from ranklist will receive 300 laddus &amp; a certificate.

In addition to it an appreciation certificate will also be provided to the winners.</p>\r\n<h4>Rules and Regulations:</h4>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>This is an IOI style contest. This means that the problems will be partially graded. You will get score for passing certain test data.</li>\r\n<li>The details of the failed test cases will also be visible on your solution page.</li>\r\n<li>You can submit solutions as many times as you'd like, there are no penalties for incorrect submissions. Only your best correct submission will be considered.</li>\r\n<li>Those who achieve the score first will be placed higher in the ranklist in case of a tie.</li>\r\n<li>The contest is meant for students of high school and middle school though everyone is invited to participate.</li>\r\n<li>There will be separate ranking page for school students.
