So when the time came to distribute the responsibility for the food stalls we all knew that the one responsible would gain maximum benefits. That started a fight. Now being very intelligent I proposed that we come to a conclusion based on some random procedure. So I proposed that we all should stand sequentially and remove every kth person from the line until only one is left. Everyone thought this to be a really good idea as only I, being the only one from CS background knew that this is not at all random. Now that I have been chosen, you have to basically prove to the team that I made a fool of them.\n<h3><b>Input Format</b></h3>\n<p>The first line contains the number of test cases, <b>t</b>. \nFor each test case, a single line contains a single number <b>n</b> denoting the number of people in the team.\n\n<h3><b>Output Format</b></h3>\n<p>For each test case the position where I stood to get the responsibility for the food stalls in a seperate line.\n\n<h3>Limits</h3>\n0<=n<=10^8\n<pre>\n\n<b>Sample Input:</b>\n2\n10 3\n20 5\n\n<b>Sample Output:</b>\n4\n7\n</pre>\n",
