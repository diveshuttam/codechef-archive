Format it like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>T</b> \u2264 <b>100</b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>N, M</b> \u2264 <b>1,000</b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 sum of <b>N</b> in all test-cases \u2264 <b>1,000</b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 sum of <b>M</b> in all test-cases \u2264 <b>1,000</b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 height of snow \u2264 <b>1,000,000,000</b></li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n2\n3 3\n1 2 2\n2 1 1\n2 1 1\n3 3\n3 2 2\n2 1 1\n2 1 1\n\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n2\n1\n</pre>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p><b>Example case 1.</b> Hasan has to select at least two cells to be in <b>S</b> so that he guarantee he can reach all other cells starting from anyone of them, example of cells to choose (2,1) and (1,2)</p>\n\n<p><b>Example case 2.</b> if Hasan chose cell (1,1) to be in <b>S</b> then he can reach any cell starting from it and thus guarantee winning</p>",
