He lays them on an infinite grid of cells, each bacterium in its own cell.<br />\nNow, these bacterium are special, as they reproduce or die following a unique pattern.\n</p>\n<p>\nHe observes that each second, the following transformations occur (all simultaneously): <br /><br />\nIf a bacterium has no neighbor to its north and no neighbor to its west, then it will die.<br /><br />\nIf a cell has no bacterium in it, but there are bacteria in the neighboring cells to the north and to the west, then a new bacterium will be born in that cell.<br />\n<br />\n</p>\n<p>\nUpon examining the grid, he notes that there are a positive, finite number of bacteria in one or more rectangular regions of cells.</p>\n<p>Now, he wants to calculate the number of seconds that will pass before all the bacteria die.<br />\nCan you help him with that?\n</p>\n<p>\nHere is an example of a grid that starts with 6 cells containing bacteria, and takes 6 seconds for all the bacteria to die. '1's represent cells with bacteria, and '0's represent cells without bacteria.<br />\n<br /><br />\n000010<br />\n011100<br />\n010000<br />\n010000<br />\n000000</p>\n<p>000000<br />\n001110<br />\n011000<br />\n010000<br />\n000000</p>\n<p>000000<br />\n000110<br />\n001100<br />\n011000<br />\n000000</p>\n<p>000000<br />\n000010<br />\n000110<br />\n001100<br />\n000000</p>\n<p>000000<br />\n000000<br />\n000010<br />\n000110<br />\n000000</p>\n<p>000000<br />\n000000<br />\n000000<br />\n000010<br />\n000000</p>\n<p>000000<br />\n000000<br />\n000000<br />\n000000<br />\n000000</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The input consists of:<br />\n<br /><br />\nOne line containing C, the number of test cases.<br />\nThen for each test case:<br /><br />\nOne line containing R, the number of rectangles of cells that initially contain bacteria.<br /><br />\nR lines containing four space-separated integers X1 Y1 X2 Y2.
