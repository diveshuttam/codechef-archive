Seeing this, Sameer decides to go too (for obvious reasons). But he doesn't like to travel by train. So he decides to do a bus-journey.\n</p>\n<p>Sameer lives in Nashik. There are N cities between Nashik and Delhi (including Delhi but excluding Nashik), and in each city there are M buses numbered 1 to M. Sameer needs to travel to Delhi following these conditions:<br />\n<br /><br />\n1. At every city, he needs to change the bus.<br />\n2. At every city, he can switch to only those buses which have number either equal to, or 1 less than, or 1 greater than the previous.\n</p>\n<p>\nAlso, a bus takes him from the present city to the next city, not beyond that.<br />\nYou are given the time (T) required by Amogh to reach Delhi, and the time required by all buses to reach the next city from the current city.\n</p>\n<p>\nCan Sameer reach Delhi before Amogh?\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>First line contains k, the number of testcases. k testcases follow. Each testcase is described as:<br />\n<br /><br />\nLine 1: T<br /><br />\nLine 2: N,M<br /><br />\nThe next N lines contain time taken by M buses to go to the next city. <br /><br />\n<br />\n</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>Output a single line saying \"YES\" or \"NO\" (without quotes), indicating whether Sameer can reach Delhi before Amogh or not.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>T</b> \u2264 <b>100</b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>N,M</b> \u2264 <b>500</b></li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n1\n14\n5 5\n1 3 1 2 6\n10 2 5 4 15\n10 9 6 7 1\n2 7 1 5 3\n8 2 6 1 9<br />\n<b>Output:</b>\nYES\n</pre><p>\u00a0</p>\n",
