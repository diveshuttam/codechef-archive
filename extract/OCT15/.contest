At CodeChef, we work hard to revive the geek in you by hosting a programming contest at the start of the month and another smaller programming challenge in the middle of the month.</p> </div> <p><br /><b class=\"rules-heading\">About CodeChef October Long Challenge:</b></p> <div class=\"rules-body\"> <p>CodeChef Long Challenge is a 10 day monthly coding contest where you can show off your computer programming skills. The significance being- it gives you enough time to think about a problem, try different ways of attacking the problem, read the concepts etc. If you're usually slow at solving problems and have ample time in hand, this is ideal for you. There would a tremendous amount of learning while competing. We also put in a lot of efforts in getting quality problems, which would in turn foster your learning while solving them.</p> </div> <p><br /><b class=\"rules-heading\">Contest Details:</b></p> <p><b class=\"rules-heading\"> </b><b>Duration: </b><span>10 Days, From 2nd October 15:00 hrs IST to 12th October 15:00 hrs IST. Check your time zone </span><a href=\"http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=CodeChef%3A+October+Challenge+2015&amp;iso=20151002T15&amp;p1=44\">here</a><span>.</span></p> <p><b class=\"rules-heading\">Eligibility Criteria: Anyone with a knack for Programming :P</b></p> <div class=\"rules-body\"> <p>Our contests are open to all the programmers across the globe. However, all the participants are expected to abide to <a href=\"http://discuss.codechef.com/questions/18662/does-codechef-have-any-code-of-conduct\">CodeChef Code Of Conduct</a>.</p> </div> <p><br /><b class=\"rules-heading\">What is in it for you?</b></p> <div class=\"rules-body\"> <p>The idea behind these programming contests is that we want you to learn while competing. Also, we believe that it is alright to refer to tutorials, books, and other materials, learn a concept and then apply the same to solve a problem during a contest. But it is\u00a0<b>not alright to copy other people's solutions or seek other people's help to solve a problem without understanding it.</b> The dividing line may seem to be thin but it can be captured by the spirit of learning. If whatever you are doing is making you learn while you do so, we tend to believe that it is alright.</p> <br /> <p>Not just that, as a token of motivation we also give away cash <a href=\"/You can know more about prizes here\">prizes</a> and goodies to the winners of the contest. However, our sole intention lies in making our users learn new concepts while competing. FYI, here are the list of prizes:</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p><span>For Indians:</span></p> <p><span>* 1st prize - INR 12000/-<br /></span><span>* 2nd prize - INR 8000/-</span></p> <p><span><br /></span></p> <p><span>For Rest of World:</span></p> <p><span>* 1st prize - $400<br /></span><span>* 2nd prize - $300</span></p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p><span>In addition to the above prizes. Top 10 global, Top 20 Indian, Top 5 school (Indian), Top 5 school (Global), Top 3 challenge problem solvers Indian and Global (apart from the winners) get cool CodeChef goodies. Starting with August Challenge 2015, top 5 girl coders will be provided with goodies, given that they are among top 100 in the final ranklist (this will be irrespective of the region).</span></p> <div></div> </div> <p><br /><b class=\"rules-heading\">Rules and Regulations:</b></p> <ul class=\"\"> <li>Please do not discuss strategy, suggestions or tips in the comments during a live contest.
