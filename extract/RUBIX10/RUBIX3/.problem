You can no longer append integers, if there is no neighbor of the last integer used which is still unvisited. You obviously can also stop anytime before this happens. <br><br>\n\nPrint the largest prime number that can be found in this fashion. If no such number exists, print -1.<br>\n(Note: Numbers which are adjacent to each other vertically or horizontally are considered neighbors).\n<br>\n\n\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>\n1.The first input will be T, the tumber of testcases. T <= 50. <br>\n2.For each test case, there would be 3 lines each having 3 integers separated by spaces.<br>\n3.Consecutive test cases are separated by a blank line.\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>\n 1.For each test case, print the largest prime number found by the above method, else print -1.<br>\n\n<h3>Example</h3>\n\n<pre>\n<b><br>Input:</b>\n1\n1 2 3\n4 5 6\n7 8 9\n<b><br>Output:</b>\n69854123\n\n</pre>\n",
