Assume that the execution time of each job scales linearly with the power of the processor. This means, if a particular job takes 2 seconds to finish on a processor with power P, it will take 1 second to finish on a processor with power 2P. He knows the processing power of each processor. Given an array A, containing the execution times of each job on a processor with 1 unit processing power, and the processing powers of the available processor, find the minimum total time taken to complete the concurrent execution of all the jobs (Note: The jobs need not be processed in the given order).\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>\n1.The first input will be T, the tumber of testcases. T <= 100<br>\n2.The next line will be the number of jobs, N. N <= 10<br>\n3.N lines follow. On the ith line, the input is an integer which lies between 1 and 30 inclusive. The ith integer is the time taken to execute the ith job on a processor with a processing power of 1 unit.\n<br>4.The next line will contain an integer P, 1 <= P <= 5. P denotes the number of processors.\n<br>5.K lines follow. The kth integer is the processing power of the kth processor.\n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>\nFor each test case, output a number which represents the sum of the first 'n' natural numbers.\n\n<h3>Example</h3>\n\n<pre>\n<b>Input:</b>\n2\n3\n10\n1\n1\n2\n20\n8\n2\n4\n4\n1\n7\n<b><br>Output:</b>\n0.500000\n1.142857\n<b><br>Explanation</b>\nFor the first case, we can use the processor with power 20 to handle the job which takes 10 <br>\nunits of time, and the other processor to handle the left two jobs. The second processor<br>\n will be done in 0.25 time units, but the other processor would be half done, and would <br>\nfinally complete its job after taking 0.5 time units. In the second case, there is only<br>\n one processor, and hence the total time taken would be (4+4)/7 = 1.42857 time units.<br>\n</pre>\n",
