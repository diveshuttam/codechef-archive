The chef teaches k types of jumps to the rabbit. Each jump has definite length L units. The rabbit does not have any brains he will use any type of jump he feels like at any point of time. He is placed on a very long mat and starts at 0 unit. The chef wants to know in how many ways he can perform his jumps and cover exactly N units of distance.\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n</p><p>The first line contains the number of the test cases T(&lt;=100). Each test case consists of 2 lines. The first line defines the distance N (1&lt;=N&lt;=10^18) which tells us the number of units the chef wants the rabbit to cover. The next line contains k the number of jumps which are taught to the rabbit, k (k&lt;=15) integers follow in the same line each denoting distinct distance L (L&lt;=15) units which can be jumped by the rabbit.\n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n</p><p>Print T integers each denoting the number of ways the rabbit can perform jumps of N units of distance. Print the remainder obtained on dividing the answer by 1000000007 if the answer is greater than or equal to 1000000007.\n\n<h3>Example</h3>\n\n<pre>\n<b>Input:</b>\n3\n10\n1 1\n13\n3 1 2 8\n15\n5 1 2 3 4 5\n\n\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n1\n415\n13624\n</pre></p>",
