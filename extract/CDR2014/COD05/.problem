He plays it on his brother Nitin's mobile since he doesn't own one.<br />\nOne day, as usual, Nikhil comes to ask Nitin if he can play the game.<br />\nNitin challenges Nikhil to write code for a puzzle he's been trying to solve for last three days.<br />\nIf Nikhil solve's it, he can play.</p>\n<p>But alas! Nikhil is not an expert programmer like you. He needs your help. Help Nikhil play FlappyBirds!</p>\n<p>The puzzle is simple. You have a 4 x 4 grid. Some of the cells in the grid are black and some white.<br />\n'b' represents black and 'a' represents white.</p>\n<pre>Eg.\n \n           babb\n           bbbb\n           aaaa\n           aabb\n</pre><p></p>\n<p>The <b>task</b> is to change the color of at-most one cell to the other color (ie. a -> b, b -> a) so that you can form a 2 x 2 grid, with all cells of the same color.</p>\n<h3>INPUT</h3>\n<p> Input has four lines, containing four characters each. If the j-th character of the i-th line is 'b', that cell is black, and so on.</p>\n<h3>OUTPUT</h3>\n<p>Print \"POSSIBLE\" (without the quotes) if it's possible to complete the <b>task</b> and \"NOT POSSIBLE\" (without the quotes) otherwise.</p>\n<h3> Sample Test:</h3>\n<h5>Sample Test 1 Input</h5>\n<p></p>\n<pre>\n bbbb\n abaa\n bbbb\n aaaa\n</pre><p></p>\n<h5>Sample Test 1 Output</h5>\n<p>POSSIBLE</p>\n<h5>Sample Test 2 Input</h5>\n<p></p>\n<pre>\n bbbb\n aaaa\n bbbb\n aaaa\n</pre><p></p>\n<h5>Sample Test 2 Output</h5>\n<p>NOT POSSIBLE</p>\n<p> Explanation for Sample Test 1 : If we re-paint the 1st cell at 2nd row, we can get a 2 x 2 grid of all cells 'b'.</p>\n",
