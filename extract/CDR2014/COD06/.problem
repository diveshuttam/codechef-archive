They like to search for new places and play dangerous games . In one such adventurous game Hilda gets trapped somewhere in the middle and Tyrion needs to save her .</p>\n<p>Hilda and Tyrion are moving on the game map which is 'N X N' square. Tyrion knows Hilda's location but he can't reach her directly. The game restricts his movements.<br />\nIf Tyrion is located at the coordinates (x,y) then he can move to co-ordinates (x+p,x+q) or (x+p,x-q) or (x-p,x+q) or (x-p,x-q)(if these coordinates exist on the map),where p and q are defined as:</p>\n<pre>\n               p=1 if q=2\n         and   p=2 if q=1\n</pre><p>So Tyrion has at most eight choices for making any moving. It will be less than eight if some of the possible co-ordinates don't exist on map.\n</p>\n<p>For example: if Tyrion is at (1,1) in a ' 4 X 4' map(as shown in figure) then he can move to (3,2)  and (2,3) .Now if Hilda is located at (3,1) then Tyrion can save her in minimum 2 moves .(in figure Tyrion's Location is marked by 'X' and Hilda's location by 'O')\n</p>\n<p><img src=\"/download/extimages/47e6196c330c70628780c7a154979b33.png\" /></p>\n<h3>INPUT:</h3>\n<p>The first line consist of number of test cases 'T' . The next line has the size of the map 'N'. The next 'T' lines have the co-ordinates of Tyrion and Hilda respectively .(Co-ordinates of Tyrion and Hilda are separated by spaces)\n </p>\n<h3>CONSTRAINTS:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>2&lt;= <b>N</b> &lt;= 8\n</li><li>1&lt;=<b>T</b>&lt;=4096\n</li></ul>\n<h3>OUTPUT:</h3>\n<p>For each test case output the minimum number of moves required for saving Hilda .If it is not possible to save her then output -1 .</p>\n<h3>SAMPLE INPUT:</h3>\n<h5>Input1:</h5>\n<pre>\n   3\n   8\n   (1,1) (8,8)\n   (1,1) (3,2)\n   (8,8) (3,3)\n</pre><h5>Output1:</h5>\n<pre>\n   6\n   1\n   4\n</pre><h5>Input2:</h5>\n<pre>\n   1\n   3\n   (1,1) (2,2)\n</pre><h5>Output2:</h5>\n<pre>\n   -1\n</pre>",
