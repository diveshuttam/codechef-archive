The road is separated into N consecutive parts. The parts are numbered 0 through N-1, in order. Cersei is going to walk from part 0 to part N-1.</p>\n<p>Cersei also noticed that each part of the road has a color: either red, green, or blue. Part 0 is red.</p>\n<p>Cersei is going to perform a sequence of steps. Each step must lead in the positive direction. That is, if her current part is i, the next step will take her to one of the parts i+1 through N-1, inclusive. Her steps can be arbitrarily long. However, longer steps are harder: a step of length j costs j*j energy.</p>\n<p>Additionally, Cersei wants to step on colors in a specific order: red, green, blue, red, green, blue, ... That is, she starts on the red part 0, makes a step to a green part, from there to a blue part, and so on, always repeating red, green, and blue in a cycle. Note that the final part N-1 also has some color and thus Cersei must reach it in a corresponding step.</p>\n<h3>INPUT:</h3>\n<p>First line consist of 't' number of test cases. The next  't' lines, each line has a string representing the road (each string has 'N' elements) . For each i, element i of string is the color of part i: 'R' represents red, 'G' green, and 'B' blue.</p>\n<h3>CONSTRAINTS:</h3>\n<p>Following holds for each string in input:<br /></p>\n<ul>\n<li>string will contain between 2 and 15 characters, inclusive.\n</li><li>each character of string will be either 'R' or 'G' or 'B'.\n</li><li>The first character of string will be 'R'.\n</li><li> 1&lt;= <b>t</b> &lt;=30\n</li></ul>\n<h3>OUTPUT:</h3>\n<p>If Cersei can reach part N-1 in the way described above, print the smallest possible total cost of doing so. Otherwise, print -1.</p>\n<h3>SAMPLE TEST CASES:</h3>\n<h5>Input:</h5>\n<pre>\n6\nRGGGB\nRGBRGBRGB\nRBBGGGRR\nRBRRBGGGBBBBR\nRG\nRBRGBGBGGBGRGGG\n</pre><h5>Output:</h5>\n<pre>\n8\n8\n-1\n50\n1\n52\n</pre>",
