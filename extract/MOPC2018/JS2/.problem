In the first game, Jenny loses the game. Jeff is very strong in counting the number of times a given string is present in the sentence. Thus, he decides to trick her by giving a string puzzle and asking her to solve it. He gives Jenny a word and asks her to find the number of times the word is found in a sentence. To complicate things, he says even if the letters are jumbled but they should be continuous it needs to be counted.\n\nYour task is to help Jenny to solve this issue. Given a string <b>W</b>, calculate the total number of times the <b>W</b> occurs in a sentence  <b>S</b>. In <b>S</b>, <b>W</b> may be jumbled, but it needs to be continuous.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\nFirst line of the input contains an integer <b>T</b> denoting the number of test cases. The description of <b>T</b> test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains the string <b>W</b>The second line contains a string <b>S</b> \n<h3>Output</h3>\nFor each test case, first line corresponds to the number of times <b>W</b> is found in <b>S</b>. The subsequent lines, should have the word.\n Arrange them in alphabetical order.<b>W</b>.\n\n<h3>Constraints\n<b>1</b> \u2264 <b>T</b> \u2264 <b>100</b>\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n1\nSam\nmsatmas\n<b>Output:</b>\n2\nmas\nmsa\n</pre>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p>The word Sam is found twice in the string Msatmas, they are <b>Msa</b>t<b>mas</b></p>",
