The N friends are sitting in one row of size N .<br />\nThe person sitting on first bench  has gameid 0, person sitting on second bench has gameid 1, third has gameid 2 and so on ...<br />\nBut they are not able to complete the game.<br />\nSo in order to complete the game they started using unfair means like using cheats.<br />\nA lot of cheats are available to them. All the cheats are distributed into 3 folders named 1 , 2 , 3.</p>\n<p>It is found that when one cheat is being used then it is used by all people who have gameid between i to j  ( both i and j are included ).<br />\nWhen the cheats are used then either the gamepoints of a person increases or decreases.<br />\n<br />\nWhen the cheats of folder 1 are used by people having gameid between i to j then the gamepoints of person having gameid i increases by one,<br />\ngamepoints of person having gameid i + 1 increases by two and gamepoints of person having gameid i + 2 increases by three and so on till j</p>\n<p>When the cheats of folder 2 are used by people having gameid between i to j then the gamepoints of all people in the  given range by certain value v.</p>\n<p>When the cheats of folder 3 are used by people having gameid between i to j then the gamepoints of all people in the  given range becomes v.</p>\n<p>A person comes  and starts to sum the gamepoints . But he was having great difficulty in calculating the sum  as N is very large<br />\nso he decided to write a program which could help him but he was not able to write it. </p>\n<p>So you have to help that person by writing a code for him which would help  him .</p>\n<pre>\nTHE INPUT WILL CONTAIN MANY OPERATIONS . BUT THE OPERATION WILL BE OF 4 TYPE ONLY\u00a0\nOPERATION 1\n1 i j    \n(this operation corresponds to cheats of folder 1)\n\nOPERATION 2 \n2 i j v  \n(this operation corresponds to cheats of folder 2)\n  \nOPERATION 3\n3 i j v \n(this operation corresponds to cheats of folder 3)\n\nOPERATION 4\n4 i j \n(this operation corresponds to finding sum of gamepoints from i to j)\n\nINTIALLY  GAMEPOINT OF EVERY PLAYER IS ZERO.</pre>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>First line contains T( no. of test cases ).<br />\nFor each test case the first line contains two integer N ( no. of friends ) , Q( no. of operations).<br />\nNext Q lines contains operations.\n</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>Output the sum of gamepoints of people from id i to j as given in the operation 4. You have to output the sum everytime operation 4 is encountered in a test case.</p>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>T</b> \u2264 <b> 10 </b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>N</b> \u2264 <b> 10^6 </b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>Q</b> \u2264 <b> 10^5 </b></li>\n<li><b>0</b> \u2264 <b>i</b> \u2264 <b> j </b><b> &lt; </b><b> N</b></li>\n<li><b>-100</b> \u2264 <b>v</b> \u2264 <b> 100 </b></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n<p>\n2\n5 4\n1 0 4\n2 0 4 1\n3 3 3 0\n4 0 4\n7 9\n1 0 6\n2 3 5 2\n3 1 2 5\n4 0 3\n2 1 5 3\n4 0 6\n3 0 6 0\n1 0 6\n4 0 6\n</p>\n<b>Output:</b>\n<p>\n15\n17\n54\n28\n</p>\n</pre>",
