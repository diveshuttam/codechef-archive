A very important component of such a system is the random number generator. It needs to be fast and random enough. Here is a compromise I came up with. I need a way to generate random numbers of length at most D. My plan is to select a prime number P = 10D. I am also going to pick non-negative integers A and B. Finally, I'm going to pick an integer seed S between 0 and P-1, inclusive.<br />\n<br /><br />\nTo output my sequence of pseudo-random numbers, I'm going to first output S and then compute the new value of S like this:<br />\nS := (A*S + B) mod P.<br />\n<br /><br />\nThen I will output the new value of S as the next number in the sequence and update S again by using the same formula. I can repeat this as many times as I want.<br />\n<br /><br />\nDo you think that this is a good random number generator? Can you write a program that takes K consecutive elements of a sequence that was generated by my random number generator, and prints the next element of the sequence?\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, T. T test cases follow. Each one starts with a line containing D and K. The next line contains K consecutive elements generated by a random number generator of the kind described above.</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>For each test case, output one line containing \"Case #x: y\", where x is the case number (starting from 1) and y is either the next number in the sequence, or the string \"I don't know.\" if the answer is ambiguous.\n</p>\n<h3>Limits</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>1 = T = 100.</li>\n<li>1 = K = 10.</li>\n\n<p>The K integers will be consecutive elements of a sequence generated by a random number generator of the type described above.\n</p></ul>\n<h3>Small dataset</h3>\n<li>1 = D = 4.</li>\n<h3>Sample</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Input </li>\n<li>3</li>\n<li>2 10</li>\n<li>0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9</li>\n<li>3 1</li>\n<li>13</li>\n<li>1 5</li>\n<li>6 6 6 6 6</li>\n<li>Output </li>\n<li>Case #1: 10</li>\n<li>Case #2: I don't know.</li>\n<li>Case #3: 6</li>\n</ul>\n",
