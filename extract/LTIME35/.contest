However, our sole intention lies in making our users learn new concepts while competing.</p> <p><b class=\"rules-heading\">For Indians:</b></p> <ul class=\"\"> <li>Top 10 school students from ranklist will get CodeChef laddus</li> </ul> <b class=\"rules-heading\">For Rest of World:</b> <ul class=\"\"> <li>Top 10 school students from ranklist will get CodeChef laddus</li> </ul> <div class=\"rules-body\"> <p>With CodeChef laddus, the winners can claim cool CodeChef goodies.
