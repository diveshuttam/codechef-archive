Player A has a string <b>s</b> with him, and player B has string <b>t</b> with him. Both <b>s</b> and <b>t</b> consist only of lower case English letters and are of equal length. A makes the first move, then B, then A, and so on alternatively. Before the start of the game, the players know the content of both the strings <b>s</b> and <b>t</b>.</p>\n\n<p>These players are building one other string w during the game. Initially, the string w is empty. In each move, a player removes any one character from their respective string and adds this character anywhere (at any position) in the string w (Note that w is a string at all times, and you can insert between characters or at the ends. It is not an empty array where you can add a character at any index. Please see the Explanations for further clarification). If at any stage of the game, the string w is of length greater than 1 and is a palindrome, then the player who made the last move wins. </p>\n\n<p>If even after the game finishes (ie. when both <b>s</b> and <b>t</b> have become empty strings), no one is able to make the string w a palindrome, then player B wins.</p>\n\n<p>Given the strings <b>s</b>, and <b>t</b>, find out which of A, B will win the game, if both play optimally.</p>\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The first line of the input contains an integer <b>T</b>, corresponding to the number of test cases. The description of each testcase follows.</li>\n<li>The first line of each testcase will contain the string <b>s</b>.</li>\n<li>The second line of each testcase will contain the string <b>t</b>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>For each test case, output \"A\" or \"B\" (without quotes) corresponding to the situation, in a new line.</p>\n\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Subtask 1</b> (20 points) : 1 \u2264 <b>T</b> \u2264 500, All characters of string <b>s</b> are equal, All characters of string <b>t</b> are equal. 1 \u2264 <b>|s| = |t|</b> \u2264 500</li>\n<li><b>Subtask 2</b> (80 points) : 1 \u2264 <b>T</b> \u2264 500, 1 \u2264 <b>|s| = |t|</b> \u2264 500 </li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n3\nab\nab\naba\ncde\nab\ncd\n<b>Output:</b>\nB\nA\nB\n</pre>\n\n<h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p><b>Testcase 1</b>: If A adds 'a' to w in the first move, B can add 'a' and make the string w = \"aa\", which is a palindrome, and hence win. Similarly, you can show that no matter what A plays, B can win. Hence the answer is B.</p>\n\n<p><b>Testcase 2</b>: Player A moves with 'a', player B can put any of the character 'c', 'd' or 'e', Now Player A can create a palindrome by adding 'a'.</p>\n\n<p><b>Testcase 3</b>: None of the players will be able to make a palindrome of length > 1. So B will win.</p>\n",
