First, she picks a number <b>N</b>. Then she starts naming <b>N</b>, 2\n* <b>N</b>, 3 * <b>N</b>, and so on. Whenever she names a number,\nshe thinks about all of the digits in that number. She keeps track of which\ndigits (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9) she has seen at least once so far\nas part of any number she has named. Once she has seen each of the ten digits\nat least once, she will fall asleep.\n</p><p>\nBella must start with <b>N</b> and must always name (<i>i</i> + 1) *\n<b>N</b> directly after <i>i</i> * <b>N</b>. For example, suppose that\nBella picks <b>N</b> = 1692. She would count as follows:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>N</b> = 1692. Now she has seen the digits 1, 2, 6, and 9.</li>\n<li>2<b>N</b> = 3384. Now she has seen the digits 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 9.</li>\n<li>3<b>N</b> = 5076. Now she has seen all ten digits, and falls asleep.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\nWhat is the last number that she will name before falling asleep? If she will\ncount forever, print <code>INSOMNIA</code> instead.\n</p>\n<hr>\n<br>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>\n<li>The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, <b>T</b>.</li>\n<li>Each consists of one line with a single integer <b>N</b>,the number Bella has chosen.</li>\n</p>\n<br>\n<hr>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>\nFor each test case, output one line containing <code>y</code> is\nthe last number that Bella will name before falling asleep, according to\nthe rules described in the statement.\n</p>\n<br>\n<hr>\n<h3>Contraints</h3>\n<p>\n1 \u2264 <b>T</b> \u2264 100.<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n0 \u2264<b>N</b> \u2264 10<sup>6</sup>.<br>\n</p>\n<br>\n<hr>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<h4>Input</h4>\n5 <br>\n0 <br>\n1 <br>\n2 <br>\n11 <br>\n1692 <br>\n<h4>Output</h4>\nINSOMNIA <br>\n10 <br>\n90 <br>\n110 <br>\n5076 <br>\n<hr><br>\n<h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p>\n<b>In Case #1</b>, since 2 * 0 = 0, 3 * 0 = 0, and so on, Bella will never see any\ndigit other than 0, and so she will count forever and never fall asleep. Poor\ngirl!\n</p><p>\n<b>In Case #2</b>, Bella will name 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. The 0 will be\nthe last digit needed, and so she will fall asleep after 10.\n</p><p>\n<b>In Case #3</b>, Bella will name 2, 4, 6... and so on. She will not see the\ndigit 9 in any number until 90, at which point she will fall asleep. By that\npoint, she will have already seen the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8,\nwhich will have appeared for the first time in the numbers 10, 10, 2, 30, 4,\n50, 6, 70, and 8, respectively.\n</p><p>\n<b>In Case #4</b>, Bella will name 11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66, 77, 88, 99, 110 and then\nfall asleep.\n</p><p>\n<b>Case #5</b> is the one described in the problem statement. Note that it would only\nshow up in the Large dataset, and not in the Small dataset.\n</p>\n</div>\n",
