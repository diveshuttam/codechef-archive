He starts to toy with it. He finds the inverse transverse function $(V_{in}/V_{out})$ i.e **(itf)** of the circuit. \n\n<img src=\"https://codechef_shared.s3.amazonaws.com/download/HYC/External_contest_images/QUCO2018/GOHAN/rlc.png\" width=\"550px\"/>\n\nDr. Gero finds out about this. He gives Gohan an $s$-controller, through which he can randomly change the values of $s$. He finds out that each value of **itf** can be achieved through multiple values of $s$. But for a single particular value of **itf**, he finds out that this is not true. That is, just for this particular value of **itf**, there is only a single value of $s$ which achieves it. \n\nTo avoid punishment, Gohan must complete a task given to him by Dr.Gero, which is to find this particular value of **itf**. He needs your help in doing that.\n\n**HINT** to solve these type of circuits. In these circuits, the capacitor and the inductor can be treated as normal resistors, with resistances as follows: The resistance of inductor is directly taken as **(s * L)** and that of capacitor is **1/(s * C)**.\n\n\n###Input:\n\n- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.\n- The first and only line of each test case contains 4 integers $R, L, C, V_{in}$, separated by single spaces. \n\n###Output:\nFor each test case, print a single line containing the answer. Your answer will be judged right if it is at most $10^{-2}$ away from the correct answer.\n\n###Constraints \n- $1 \\leq T \\leq 2$\n- $1 \\leq R \\leq 10^5$\n- $1 \\leq L \\leq 10^5$\n- $1 \\leq C \\leq 10^5$\n- $1 \\leq V_{in} \\leq 10^9$\n\n###Sample Input:\n```\n2\n4 5 78 60\n4 5 6 3\n```\n###Sample Output:\n```\n-61.4\n-3.8\n```",
