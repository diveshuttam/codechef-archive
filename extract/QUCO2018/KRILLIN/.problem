Kami gives them a quiz to solve in return for the dragon ball.\n\nHe gives them an array $A$ (having 1 based indexing) of $N$ integers and he'll ask them $Q$ queries. The array is basically a frequency table which represents some data. It signifies that $i$ occurs $A[i]$ times in the data. The queries can be of two types -\n\n1 $L$ $R$\n\n2 $i$ $x$\n\nFirst query - They must find the $mode$ and $median$ in the range $L$ to $R$ where $L$ and $R$ are inclusive ($L$ and $R$ are indices of the array) and return their $LCM$. It is guaranteed that there will be an unique mode.\n\nSecond query- The element at $i$th index must be updated to $x$.\n\n$1$ represents the first query and $2$ represents the second query.\n\nNote: Use greatest integer function for computing the median. This means that the median should be the floor value if the computed median is a fraction.\n\n###Input:\n\n- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.\n- The first line of each test case contains two integers $N$, $Q$ separated by a single space.\n- The second line of each test case contains $N$ integers denoting elements of the array separated by single spaces.\n- The next $Q$ lines contain respective queries.\n\n###Output:\nFor each test case, print results of only the first type of queries in separate lines.\n\n###Constraints \n- $1 \\leq T \\leq 2$\n- $1 \\leq N \\leq 10^5$\n- $1 \\leq Q \\leq 10^5$\n- $1 \\leq L \\leq R \\leq N$\n- $1 \\leq x \\leq 10^9$\n- $1 \\leq i \\leq N$\n- $1 \\leq A_1, A_2, A_3, ..., A_n \\leq 10^9$\n- At every point of time, the frequency array will have all distinct elements. That is, at any particular moment, there will never be $A_i = A_j$.\n\n###Sample Input:\n\t2\n\t5 3\n2 4 6 8 9  \n   1 1 3     \n  2 2 56     \n  1 1 3     \n  7 6    \n  20 8 50 16 22 23 29   \n  1 1 6     \n  2 2 18   \n  1 1 4    \n  2 6 10    \n  2 5 11    \n  1 5 6    \n\n###Sample Output:\n\t6\n2   \n3   \n3   \n5\n \n\t\n###EXPLANATION:\nExample case 1: The frequency array is 2 4 6 8 9. For the first query- 1 1 3 the range is 1 to 3, i.e. for frequency 2 to 6. The mode element is 3 since it has the maximum frequency(6) in this subarray and the median is 2.5 which will be floored down to 2. Their Lcm is 6. So for this query 6 will be the output. \n\nFor the second query - 2 2 56 The element at the 2nd index which is 4 will be replaced by 56. The array will now become 2 56 6 8 9. This array will be used for the upcoming queries. But for a query of this type, no output is there. \n\nFor the third query- 1 1 3 The array is 2 56 6 8 9 and the range is 1 to 3 with corresponding frequencies 2, 56, 6. The mode element is 2 since it has the maximum frequency(56) in this subarray and the median is 2. Their LCM i.e 2 is the output.\n",
