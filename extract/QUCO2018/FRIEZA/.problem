In order to do that he must acquire all the seven dragon balls. In a legendary fight, he is able to defeat Kami, the Guardian of the dragon balls. Now he has come across a case that contains the dragon balls and he needs your help to open it. \n\nThe case requires a pin number to be unlocked. And the clever Kami has left a puzzle on the case which must be cracked to unlock the case.\n\nOn the case, is displayed a string, $S$ of length $N$ consisting of lowercase alphabets. To unlock, he needs to convert this string into a pin number $R$. \n\nThe trick to creating that pin lies in his name $[f, r, i, e, z, a]$. Every character in $S$ is either $good$ or $bad$. It is $good$, if it is a part of the letter set $[f, r, i, e, z, a]$. It is $bad$ otherwise. He'll have to traverse $S$ one by one and count consecutive letters that are $good$ or $bad$ and then store these corresponding counts in the same order in $R$. Thus the pin number, $R$ will be a concatenation of the counts of these letters. See Sample Input for more details.\n\nYou have to help him find out $R$.\n\n###Input:\n\n- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows. \n- Each test case contains a single string $S$ consisting of lowercase characters $[a-z]$.\n\n###Output:\nFor each test case, output in a single line answer denoting the decoded string which Frieza can use to attain immortality.\n\n###Constraints \n- $1 \\leq T \\leq 5$\n- $1 \\leq N \\leq 10^5$\n- $S$ consists of only lower case alphabets.\n\n###Sample Input:\n\t2\n\tkrillinisdead\nfuturetrunks\n\n###Sample Output:\n\t122111221\n\t132114\n\n###EXPLANATION:\n*Example case 1:* The string $S$ is \"krillinisdead\". The letter, \"k\" does not belong to the set $[f, r, i, e, z, a]$ and hence it's count, i.e., 1 is appended to the string $R$. \"ri\" belongs to the set $[f, r, i, e, z, a]$ and hence 2 is appended to $R$. \"ll\" doesn't belong to the set $[f, r, i, e, z, a]$, so it's count 2 is appended to the string $R$. The string $R$ keeps getting updated and the final answer is returned when the input string has been completely traversed.",
