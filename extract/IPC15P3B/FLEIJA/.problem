It is pronounced \"Freyja\", in reference to the Norse goddess of love and magic.Nina Einstein was also able to develop a countermeasure for the F.L.E.I.J.A. known as the F.L.E.I.J.A. Eliminator.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe F.L.E.I.J.A. is with Sneizel. To stop the F.L.E.I.J.A , Lelouch has to gather all his soldiers. But, due to strategical benefits, currently his soldiers are scattered. The Battle Field can be visualised as a single dimensional line. There are <b>A<sub>i</sub></b> soldiers at Point i which is located at <b>X<sub>i</sub></b>. All of them should be gathered at point <b>X</b>.  There are bridges connecting Point i and i+1, and also between point <b>N</b> and <b>X</b>.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe width of the bridge is rather limited. The ith bridge has capacity <b>C<sub>i</sub></b> which denotes the maximum number of soldiers that can be present in any unit of the bridge at a particular time. The soldiers can travel 1 unit distance in 1 sec.They move discretely. i.e. in a particular unit time, a solider moves 1 unit or does not move at all. There are no movements for time periods not multiple of unit time. Find the minimum time in which all the soldiers can reach <b>X</b>. Please refer to the sample input output to get better understanding. </p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The first line of the input contains <b>N</b> denoting the number of points at which soldiers are situated. Next line contains <b>N</b> space separated integers <b>A<sub>i</sub></b> denoting the number of soldiers at each point.<br />\nNext line contains <b>N</b> space separated integers <b>X<sub>i</sub></b> denoting the location of ith point. It is guaranteed that <b>X<sub>i</sub></b> &lt; <b>X<sub>(i+1)</sub></b> and <b>X<sub>n</sub></b> &lt; <b>X</b>. Next line contains <b>N</b> space separated integers denoting <b>C<sub>i</sub></b> the capacity of bridge between ith bridge. The <b>N</b>th  bridge is the one between point <b>N</b> and <b>X</b>.<br />\nNext line contains a single integer denoting location of <b>X</b>. </p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>Output single integer denoting the minimum time in which all the soldiers can reach X. It is guaranteed that the output fits in a 64 bit integer.</p>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>N</b> \u2264 <b>10<sup>5</sup></b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>C<sub>i</sub>,X<sub>i</sub>,A<sub>i</sub>,X</b> \u2264 <b>10<sup>9</sup></b></li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre>\n<b>Input 1 :</b>\n1\n9 \n1\n2\n3\n\n<b>Input 2 :</b>\n2\n16 9\n1 4\n8 3\n9\n\n<b>Output 1 :</b>\n6\n\n<b>Output 2 :</b>\n13\n</pre><p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Explanation for test 1</h3>\n<p>The number of soldiers at locations 1,2,3 are as follows <br /><br />\nt =0 : (9,0,0)<br />\n<br /><br />\nt =1 : (7,2,0)<br />\n<br /><br />\nt = 2 : (5,2,2)<br />\n<br /><br />\nt = 3 : (3,2,4)<br />\n<br /><br />\nt = 4 : (1,2,6)<br />\n<br /><br />\nt = 5 : (0,1,8)<br />\n<br /><br />\nt = 6 : (0,0,9)<br />\n<br /> </p>\n",
