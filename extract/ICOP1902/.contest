Although, even college students aspiring for ICPC will also get help from this contest.     This is unrated and is hosted just for the sake of problem-solving practice. The problems will be set by a group of students     who have qualified for IOITC or have had the pain of not clearing it.</p>\r\n<h4>Contest Details</h4>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Duration:         <span>4 hours</span> </li>\r\n<li>Start time         <span>:             <span>26th August 2018, 19:00 hrs IST</span> </span> </li>\r\n<li> <strong>End time</strong>:         <span>26th August 2018, 23:00 hrs </span> <span>IST.</span> </li>\r\n<li> <strong>Prizes: </strong>250         <span>CodeChef </span>laddus each for top 3 school students from India.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p class=\"last\">You may check your timezone     <a href=\"https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=CodeChef%3A+ICO+Preparatory+Contest+2019+%232&amp;iso=20180826T19&amp;p1=44&amp;ah=4\" target=\"_blank\">here</a></p>\r\n<h4>About International Olympiad in Informatics</h4>\r\n<p>The     <a href=\"/ioi\" target=\"_blank\">IOI</a> is one of five international science olympiads.

Another important goal is to bring together exceptionally talented pupils from various     countries and to have them share scientific and cultural experiences.</p>\r\n<p class=\"last\">The IOI is organized annually in and by one of the participating countries. Each participating country typically sends a     delegation of four contestants and two accompanying adults. Students compete individually and try to maximize their score     by solving a set of informatics problems during two competition days. Cultural and recreational events are organized     on the remaining days.</p>\r\n<h4>About Indian Computing Olympiad</h4>\r\n<p class=\"last\">The Indian Computing Olympiad consists of Zonal Computing Olympiad, Zonal Informatics Olympiad, Indian National Olympiad     in Informatics and IOI Training Camp which is conducted by the Indian Association for Research in Computing Science (IARCS)     as the procedure of selection to the IOI.</p>\r\n<h4>Registration</h4>\r\n<p class=\"last\">You just need to have a CodeChef username to participate.
