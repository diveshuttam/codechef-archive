    "body": "<span class=\"solution-visible-txt\">All submissions for this problem are available.</span>Once upon a time, Our Great friend Vijju was feeling very lonely because he had no friends. He was traveling country to country, seeking something that might reduce this feeling of loneliness. He reached GameChef Store, the best game store of the world and decided to buy some games to make new friends.\n\n\nThere are $N$ games in the GameChef store. Each game $i$ has a number $W[i]$ associated with it, the number of additional friends Vijju can make by buying this game.\n\nBut the games are very strange. Every game except Game 1 require that user have atleast played Game $P[i]$. Formally, For buying Game $i$, Vijju have to buy game $P[i]$ too. Also, Each game x can have at most 3 games that require Game x to be bought.\n\nVijju is not sure how many games to buy. So, He ask you to find out maximum number of friends he can make, by Buying x games, for every $1 \\leq x \\leq N$.\n\n_PS: Don't worry about Vijju, Since he has Taran as his friend now._\n\n###Input\n- First Line contains a single Integer $T$, denoting number of test cases. Each test case consist of $3$ lines.\n- Each test case begin with $N$, Number of games available in GameChef store.\n- Next line contains $N$ Integers, ith integer denoting $W[i]$.\n- Next line contain $N-1$ integers, ith integer denoting $P[i+1]$, ($P[i+1] <= i$).\n\n###Output\nFor every test case, Print N integers in a single line, denoting maximum number of friends Vijju can make, by buying exactly i games for every $1 \\leq i \\leq N$ games.\n\n###Constraints\n- $1 \\leq T \\leq 10$.             \n- $1 \\leq N \\leq 100$.               \n- $1 \\leq W[i] \\leq 10^6$.               \n- No game appear more than 3 times in P.            \n\n###Subtask\n\n- Subtask 1 (15 points): $1 \\leq N \\leq 10$.\n- Subtask 2 (35 points): $1 \\leq N \\leq 50$. No game appear more that 2 times in P.\n- Subtask 3 (50 points): Original Constraints.\n\n###Sample Input\n2           \n5            \n1 2 3 4 5           \n1 2 3 4            \n5                \n1 2 3 4 5                \n1 1 2 3\n\n###Sample Output\n1 3 6 10 15             \n1 4 9 11 15    \n\n###Explanation\n\nFor sample input 2, When Vijju has to buy three games, he chooses Game 1, Game 3 and Game 5 to get 9 friends, which is maximum.",
