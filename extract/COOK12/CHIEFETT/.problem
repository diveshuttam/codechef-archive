    "body": "<span class=\"solution-visible-txt\">All submissions for this problem are available.</span><p style=\"text-align:justify\">Chef's girlfriend, Chief, is displeased with him. This is not a good sign for their<br />\n\trelationship, and as always, he has turned to you for help. He looks forward to take his girlfriend to shopping;<br />\n\toffering her to buy 'K' gifts. The shop that he is taking her to has 'N' unique items, that is,<br />\n\tthere is single quantity of each item (its a very special shop, you see!).</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Chef has with him, K discount coupons that he wishes to use. The shop's policy<br />\n\tonly allows Chef to use one discount coupon on any one purchased item. That is why Chef is letting Chief buy K<br />\n\tgifts; he intends to use each coupon with him.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Chef of course cannot stop Chief from buying whatever she likes. Chief would select any K<br />\n\tgifts, from among the N items that the shop has. She makes selection of any K out of N items, uniformly. Suppose,<br />\n\tthere are 5 items and Chef lets Chief buy 3, then she selects any of the 3 out of 5 items with the probability 1/10.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">After Chief selects the items she wishes to buy, Chef will have to pay the bill. Smart as he<br />\n\tis, he would apply the K discount coupons on the K items (one on each) such that the discount he receives is as large<br />\n\tas possible.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Chef wants to prepare himself for this day. He knows beforehand the price of each item<br />\n\tin the shop. Can you tell him what expected discount can he expect? You have to tell him the expected discount<br />\n\tin the amount of money he can expect to save.</p>\n<p style=\"font-size:1.5em;font-weight:bold\">Input format</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The first line contains the number T, the number of test cases. In the following lines,<br />\n\tT test cases follow (without any newlines between them.)<br />\nEach case consists of only 3 lines.<br />\nThe first line of each test case contains N and K, separated by a single space.<br />\nThe second line contains N positive integers, the prices of the N items respectively, separated by a single space.<br />\nThe third line contains K positive integers (between 1 and 100, inclusive) separated by a single space. They represent<br />\nthe percentage of discount offered by the coupons, that Chef has, respectively.</p>\n<p style=\"font-size:1.5em;font-weight:bold\">Output format</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">For each test case, print the expected amount of money Chef should expect to save.<br />\n\tOutput the result rounded to 3 digits after the decimal.</p>\n<p style=\"font-size:1.5em;font-weight:bold\">Constraints</p>\n<p>1 \u2264 T \u2264 50<br />\n1 \u2264 N \u2264 1000<br />\n1 \u2264 K \u2264 N<br />\n1 \u2264 prices \u2264 10000</p>\n<p style=\"font-size:1.5em;font-weight:bold\">Sample input</p>\n<pre>2\n3 2\n100 200 300\n10 20\n4 3\n100 200 300 400\n10 20 30\n\n</pre><p style=\"font-size:1.5em;font-weight:bold\">Sample output</p>\n<pre>66.667\n175.000\n\n</pre><p style=\"font-size:1.5em;font-weight:bold\">Explanation</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">In the second case, Chief can make the following selections:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>(100, 200, 300), with probability 1/4. Chef can apply the coupons to at best save 140.</li>\n<li>(100, 200, 400), with probability 1/4. Chef can apply the coupons to at best save 170.</li>\n<li>(100, 300, 400), with probability 1/4. Chef can apply the coupons to at best save 190.</li>\n<li>(200, 300, 400), with probability 1/4. Chef can apply the coupons to at best save 200.</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Thus Chef can save an expected (140 + 170 + 190 + 200) / 4 = 175.000</p>\n",
