    "body": "<span class=\"solution-visible-txt\">All submissions for this problem are available.</span><p style=\"text-align:justify\">Chef loves that his cooks involve themselves in group activities.<br />\n\tThis month, Chef has involved his cooks in a rather very curious game.<br />\n\tIt involves all his cooks, standing in a circle. Each cook is given one integer to keep,<br />\n\twhich may be positive or negative (or zero).<br />\n\tThe sum of all the integers, given to the cooks, is positive.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Suppose there are N (N \u2265 3) cooks. Cooks are labeled from 1 to N.<br />\n\tk's neighbors are (k-1) and (k+1), as they are standing in a circle.<br />\n\tNote that if k = 1, k-1 wraps around to N; and if k = N, k+1 wraps around to 1.<br />\n\tLet A[i] represent the integer that is kept by the cook i.<br />\n\tThe game proceeds in turns. In each turn, any one cook may opt to play.<br />\n\tNow, suppose the cook k wants to play in this turn, the following changes happen, in the given order:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A[k-1] = A[k-1] + A[k]</li>\n<li>A[k+1] = A[k+1] + A[k]</li>\n<li>A[k] = -A[k]</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The game would end as soon as all the numbers kept by the cooks (each A[i]) is non-negative.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Cooks are very impatient people!<br />\n\tThey want to end the game as quickly as possible!<br />\n\tHelp them determine a sequence in which they must play, such that the number of turns in which<br />\n\tthe game finishes, is as low as possible.<br />\n\tFor the purpose of this problem, you are to find the minimum number of turns in which the game can end!</p>\n<p style=\"font-size:1.5em;font-weight:bold\">Input format</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The first line contains the number T, the number of test cases. In the following lines, T test cases follow (without any newlines between them.) Each test case consists of exactly two lines.<br />\nThe first line contains the only positive integer N, the number of cooks playing the game. The second line contains N space separated integers, the initial numbers kept by the cooks.</p>\n<p style=\"font-size:1.5em;font-weight:bold\">Output format</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">For each test case, print the minimum number of turns in which the game can end.</p>\n<p style=\"font-size:1.5em;font-weight:bold\">Constraints</p>\n<p>1 \u2264 T \u2264 10<br />\n3 \u2264 N \u2264 50000<br />\n-200000 \u2264 (initial numbers kept by the cooks) \u2264 200000</p>\n<p style=\"font-size:1.5em;font-weight:bold\">Sample input</p>\n<pre>2\n3\n1 -1 2\n3\n4 -2 -1\n\n</pre><p style=\"font-size:1.5em;font-weight:bold\">Sample output</p>\n<pre>1\n6\n\n</pre><p style=\"font-size:1.5em;font-weight:bold\">Explanation</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">In the first case, cook 2 can take the first turn which converts the sequence into<br />\n\t(0, 1, 1) and end the game.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">In the second case, the following sequence of moves are optimal.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>0. (4, -2, -1) -- initial</li>\n<li>1. (3, -3, 1) -- after cook 3 moves</li>\n<li>2. (0,  3, -2) -- after cook 2 moves</li>\n<li>3. (-2, 1, 2) -- after cook 3 moves</li>\n<li>4. (2, -1, 0) -- after cook 1 moves</li>\n<li>5. (1, 1, -1) -- after cook 2 moves</li>\n<li>6. (0, 0, 1) -- after cook 3 moves</li>\n</ul>\n",
