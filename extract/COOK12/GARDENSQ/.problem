    "body": "<span class=\"solution-visible-txt\">All submissions for this problem are available.</span><p>Chef has just finished the construction of his new garden. He has sown the garden with patches of the most beautiful carpet grass he could find. He has filled it with patches of different color and now he wants to evaluate how elegant his garden is.</p>\n\n<p>Chef's garden looks like a rectangular grid of cells with N rows and M columns. So there are N x M cells in total.\tIn each cell Chef planted grass of some color.</p>\n\n<p>The elegance of the garden is defined by the number of squares, composed of at least four  garden cells, with edges parallel to the sides of the garden, that have four corner cells of the same color.</p>\n\n<p>Given the description of Chef's garden, calculate how many such squares exist.</p>\n\n<p>Input format</p>\n\n<p>The first line contains the number T, the number of test cases. In the following lines,\tT test cases follow (without any newlines between them.)\nThe first line of each test case contains N and M, separated by a single space.\nEach of the next N lines contains M characters without any spaces between them, and without any leading or trailing spaces.\nEach character describes the color of the corresponding cell in the garden and belongs to the set of lowercase and uppercase lettes of the English alphabet.\nOne letter in lowercase and uppercase describes different colors.</p>\n\n<p>Output format</p>\n\n<p>For each test case, print the number of squares that conform to the definition in the\tproblem statement.</p>\n\n<p>Constraints</p>\n\n<p>1 \u2264 T \u2264 50<br />\n1 \u2264 N, M \u2264 50<br />\n\n</p><p>Sample input</p>\n\n<pre>3\n2 2\naa\naA\n3 3\naba\nbab\naba\n4 4\naabb\naabb\nbbaa\nbbaa\n\n</pre>\n\n<p>Sample output</p>\n\n<pre>0\n1\n4\n\n</pre>\n\n<p>Explanation</p>\n\n<p>In the first case the only avaliable square does not conform to the definition in the problem statement because 'a' and 'A' describes different colors.</p>\n\n<p>In the second case, you can select the 4 a's at the corners of the garden.</p>\n\n<p>In the third case, you can only make four squares, from the four 2x2 segments\tthat are of the same color.</p>",
