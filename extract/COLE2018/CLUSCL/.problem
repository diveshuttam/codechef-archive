The time it shows happens to coincide with the true time twice every 24 hours.\n\nChef has a useless clock which does not run properly. More specifically, it runs at $K$ times the rate of a correct clock, where $K \\ne 1$. It may even be that $K$ is negative, which means the clock runs backwards. Chef also has a clock which precisely shows the current time without error.\n\nAt 12 am on day $1$ Chef sets the useless clock to point to 12:00. Of course Chef's correct clock already points to 12:00. Chef wonders on which day the time shown by the useless clock will coincide with the correct clock for the $N^{th}$ time. \n\nCan you help him find the answer without having to wait for that many days?   \nNote that 12 am of day $d$ is considered the first instant of day $d$. Since the clocks initially show the same time at 12 am of day $1$, that is counted as the first time they coincide.\n\n###Input:\n- First line will contain $T$, the number of test cases.\n- The next $T$ lines each contain 3 integers $p$, $q$ and $N$, where $\\frac{p}{q} = K$.\n\n###Output:\n- For each test case, output a single integer which is the day on which the times of the clocks coincide for the $N^{th}$ time.\n\n###Constraints \n- $1 \\leq T \\leq 10^5$\n- $-100 \\leq K \\leq 100$\n- $K \\ne 1$\n- $1 \\leq q \\leq 10^4$\n- $1 \\leq N \\leq 10^6$\n\n###Sample Input:\n    4\n    0 1 5\n    -1 2 3\n    2 1 10\n    99 100 2\n\n###Sample Output:\n    3\n    1\n    5\n    51\n\t\n###Explanation:\n- **Case 1**: Here $K = 0$. A broken clock is right twice a day. So it will be right for the fifth time on day $3$.\n- **Case 2**: Here $K = -1/2$. The clock moves backwards at half the rate of the correct clock. The time displayed will coincide with the true time first at 12 am, then at 8 am and for the third time at 4 pm on day $1$.\n",
