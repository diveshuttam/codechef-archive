In case two chefs report to the same chef they must report at different times . The time of reporting can have only two values : Morning or Evening ( denoted by M and E , respectively ) .The Head Chef himself is not part of the reporting structure . The Head Chef has found that a new restaurant in Byteland is opening and it is hiring a group of chefs from some existing restaurant . The new restaurant will basically make an offer to one of the chefs and all the chefs directly or indirectly reporting to the chef . The Head Chef is worried that the new restaurant may be taking away some of his chefs . The Head Chef knows that the new restaurant will not change the reporting structure of the chefs . The Head Chef also has access to the reporting structure of the new restaurant in terms of ages of Chefs  . The Head Chef wants to know whether there is a need to worry or not . He needs to worry if the new restaurant can possibly be targetting his chefs . </p>\n<p>\nIn short given a tree <b> T</b> and another tree <b>O</b> you need to tell whether <b> O </b> is a subtree of <b> T </b> or not . The node values of <b> T </b> or <b> O </b> need not be distinct as they represent the age of the Chef . Also , a subtree of a rooted tree includes a particular node and the entire tree structure below it . </p>\n<p> Two trees A and B are considered same if age(A->root ) = age(B->root) and subtree rooted at A->left is same as subtree rooted at B->left and subtree rooted at A->right is same as subtree rooted B->right .\n</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The first line of the input contains an integer <b>N</b> denoting the number of chefs in Head Chef's restaurant. The Chefs are denoted by number <b>1</b> to <b>N </b>.\n</li><li> The next <b> N </b> lines contain ages of the chefs with the <b>i</b> th line containing the age of chef <b>i </b>. </li>\n<li> The next <b> N - 1</b> lines contain two integers <b> A </b> and <b> B </b> and a character <b> C </b> which is either <b>'M'</b> or <b>'E'</b> where <b>A </b> denotes the senior chef and <b>B </b> denotes the reporting chef , and the character <b>C </b>  denotes the time of reporting . </li>\n<li>The next line of the input contains an integer <b>Q</b> denoting the number of queries/possible structures of chefs of new restaurant . This is followed by description of <b>Q</b> queries . </li>\n<li>The first line of each query contains an integer <b>M</b> denoting the number of chefs in new restaurant. The Chefs are denoted by numbers <b>1 </b> to <b>M</b>. </li>\n<li> The next <b> M </b> lines contain the ages of the chefs with the <b>i</b> th line denoting the age of chef <b> i </b>.</li>\n<li> The next <b> M - 1</b> lines contain two integers <b> A </b> and <b> B </b> and a character <b> C </b> which is either <b>'M' </b> or <b>'E'</b> where <b>B </b> denotes the reporting chef and <b>A </b> denotes the chef who takes the reporting , and the character <b>C </b>  denotes the time of reporting . </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<ul>\nFor each test case answer \"YES\" or \"NO\" as applicable .\n</ul>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b>2</b> \u2264 <b>N</b> \u2264 <b>100000</b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>M</b> \u2264 <b>1000</b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>Q</b> \u2264 <b>200</b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>Age of Chef</b> \u2264 <b>100</b></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n5\n1\n2\n1\n2\n1\n1 2 M\n1 3 E\n2 4 E\n3 5 M\n2\n2\n1\n2\n1 2 M\n2\n1\n1\n1 2 M\n<b>Output:</b>\nNO\nYES\n</pre><p>\u00a0</p>\n",
