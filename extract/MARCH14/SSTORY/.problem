(apparentely, opposites attract, alikes repel right?)</p>\n<p>However, as Lira didn't want to lose contact with her, she decided to mix Art and Computer Science one last time and amaze her friend with Computer Science, so she could have a geek coding partner.</p>\n<p>To amaze her, she encoded a message in two strings, which she presented to her friend:</p>\n<p>Lira: \"So, Mary, as you can see, we have two strings here, yes? We have a first longer string, <b>S1</b>, which encodes our common path together, and is represented by some letters which represent our lives so far as well all the events we lived together.</p>\n<p>The second string, <b>S2</b>, will be as long as the first one, or possibly shorter and it is here to represent what the future might bring to both of us :) It is also only composed of letters, which represent some life events we might still experience together in the future.</p>\n<p>What I would like you to do, is to find out if the future will be just like now, and, for that,you need to find a contiguous sequence of letters in both of these two strings.</p>\n<p>Obviously, as I want our friendship to last very, very much, I ask you to find the longest sequence of life events we might still experience together  and tell me which sequence is it and how long is it :D</p>\n<p>However, if fate doesn't want us to be together, simply tell me the number 0 and we shall both head separate ways forever.</p>\n<p>Turns out, that after Mary solved the problem, she became so interested in CS herself, that both she and Lira are now working together at a very reputable software company. :) </p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The input will consist of two strings composed only of the letters <b>a..z</b>, both of which are at most 250.000 characters in length.</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>The output should be as stated.</p>\n<p>If there is a common life event in Mary and Lira's lives, you should output it on a single line and, on another line, you should output the length of the event.</p>\n<p>Otherwise, simply output 0.</p>\n<p><b>\n<p>On the case where there are multiple answers, the first common event to be found on the second string, should be written to output, followed by its length. See example 3 for details.</p>\n<p></p></b></p>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>|S1|</b> \u2264 <b>250000</b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>|S2|</b> \u2264 <b>250000</b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>|S2|</b> \u2264 <b>|S1|</b></li>\n<li><b>The last constraint simply means that S2 will never be larger than S1</b></li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input 1:</b>\nadsyufsfdsfdsf\nfdyusgfdfyu\n\n<b>Output 1:</b>\nfd\n2\n</pre><p>\u00a0</p>\n<pre><b>Input 2:</b>\nadsyufsfdsfdsf\nbbbbbbbbb\n\n<b>Output 2:</b>\n0\n</pre>\n<pre><b>Input 3:</b>\nabcdef\ndefabc\n\n<b>Output 3:</b>\ndef\n3\n</pre>\n<h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p><b>Example case 1.</b>The longest life event is <b>\"fd\"</b> whose length is 2.</p>\n<p><b>Example case 2.</b>The girls will follow separate lives.</p>\n<p><b>Example case 3.</b>On the case where multiple events can happen, <b>Mary will choose the event which is closer to happen in the future</b>, and, as such, answer is \"def\".</p>\n<p><b>Note: The Mary in this problem, is actually a small tribute to my coder friend Mary Kuchumova, which, hopefully will return to Codechef and get back in touch again. :D Mary, you're missed!</b></p>\n",
