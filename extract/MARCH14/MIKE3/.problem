He has a lot of rare and unusual ones in his collection. Unfortunately, a few days ago he was fired from his well-paid job.</p>\n<p>But he doesn't complain about that, he acts! That's why Mike picked up <b>N</b> stamps from his collection and is going to sell them. He has already placed an announcement on the Internet and got <b>M</b> offers. Each offer can be described as a set of stamps, that the buyer wants to buy. Now Mike needs your help to choose a set of offers, that he should accept. </p>\n<p>He can't accept offers partially. Also, as far as Mike has the only copy of each stamp, he can sell one stamp to at most one buyer.</p>\n<p>Of course, Mike wants to maximize the number of accepted offers. Help him!\n</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n\n<p>The first line contains two integer <b>N</b> and <b>M</b>, denoting the number of the stamps and the number of the offers.</p>\n<p>The next <b>M</b> lines contain the descriptions of the offers. The <b>(i+1)</b>'th line of the input contains the description of the <b>i</b>'th offer and corresponds to the following pattern: <b>K<sub>i</sub></b> <b>A<sub>i,  1</sub></b> <b>A<sub>i,  2</sub></b>, ..., <b>A<sub>i,     K<sub>i</sub></sub></b>. <b>K<sub>i</sub></b> - is the number of the stamps, which the <b>i</b>'th buyer wants to buy, <b>A<sub>i</sub></b> - is the list of the stamps sorted in the ascending order.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>Output should contain the only integer, denoting the maximal number of the offers, that Mike can accept.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<p>1 \u2264 <b>N</b> \u2264 20,000</p>\n<p>1 \u2264 <b>M</b> \u2264 20</p>\n<p>1 \u2264 <b>K<sub>i</sub></b></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n4 3\n2 1 2\n2 2 3\n2 3 4\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n2\n</pre><p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p>In the example test Mike should accept the first and the third offer.</p>\n",
