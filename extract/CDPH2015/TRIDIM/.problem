This dimension consists entirely of a finite number of rooms, arranged in a triangle, each with numbers written on the floor. Each room has two doors that open into a room ahead of it. By extension, this means that each room also has one or two doors leading backwards. However, the room at the top of the triangle has no doors leading backwards, and the rooms in the bottom row have no doors leading ahead. See the figure below.</p>\n<p>\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a03<br /><br />\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a07 4<br /><br />\n\u00a0\u00a02 3 6<br /><br />\n\u00a08 5 9 3<br /><br />\n4 8 6 5 2<br />\n</p>\n<p>In this figure, from the top room he can travel to the rooms 7 or 4. From the room 7 he can travel to the rooms 2 or 3, and so on. He also has the option to backtrack at any point.</p>\n<p>Max starts out in the room at the top of the triangle. To escape the dimension, he must find the path to the bottom row of rooms that gives him the maximum possible sum of floor numbers. As soon as he has traveled this path, he will be transported back home.</p>\n<p>Max is in no mood for guesswork. So he decides that at each room he will take the right hand door. But if has already taken that particular door in the past, then he will take the left hand door. If he has taken both doors in the past, or if he has reached the bottom row without escaping, then he will go one room back through the most recently used backwards door.</p>\n<p>Given a triangle of rooms, find the number of distinct paths to the bottom row (including the longest path) that Max will have traveled before he is transported back home.</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The first line contains N, the number of rows in the triangle. This is followed by N lines, of which the ith line contains a row of i space separated values. Each value is the floor number K for a room.</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>Output a single number modulo 1000000007 representing the number of distinct paths to be traveled as described above.</p>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<p>Should contain all the constraints on the input data that you may have. Format it like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>N</b> \u2264 <b>100</b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>K</b> \u2264 <b>1000</b></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n4\n3\n7 4\n2 3 5\n8 5 9 3\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n4\n</pre><h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p>The largest sum path is 3->7->3->9. But before traveling this path, Max will also have traveled 3->7->2->8, 3->7->2->5, and 3->7->3->5 in that order. Hence the total number of paths traveled is 4.\n</p>\n",
