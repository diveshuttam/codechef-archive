To increase his sales he decides to organize a lottery system, where you get one digit for every item you buy. A person's lottery number is formed by taking all the digits they received, in the order in which they were received.</p>\n<p>For example, if a person buys items A, B and C in that order, and gets digits 1, 5, and 7 respectively for these items, then that person's lottery number is 157.</p>\n<p>Now, Chef is an intelligent guy, so he decides that the lottery number wins if it is a palindrome. But he finds that there are a lot of palindromes so a lot of people win the lottery. He decides that he'll change the rule a little.</p>\n<p>Under the new rules, for a lottery number of length N, the last K digits together should form a prime number, and the remaining N-K digits together should form a palindrome.</p>\n<p>Chef wants to find out how many winning lottery numbers exist for a given value of N and K.</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The first line contains T, the number of test cases. It is followed by T lines, each of which contains 2 integers, N and K, separated by a space.</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>For each test case, output the possible number of tickets (as described above) modulo 1000000007</p>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>T</b> \u2264 <b>1000</b></li>\n<li><b>2</b> \u2264 <b>N</b> \u2264 <b>10^18</b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>K</b> \u2264 <b>9</b></li>\n<li><b>K</b> &lt; <b>N</b></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n2\n2 1\n4 2\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n36\n225\n\n</pre><h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p><b>Example case 1.</b><br /><br />\nK is 1. There are 4 possible prime numbers of 1 digit: [2, 3, 5, 7]. N-K is 1. There are 9 possible palindromes: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] (numbers of length 1 are trivially palindromes). The total number of possibilities is 9 * 4 = 36. 36 % 1000000007 = 36.<br /></p>\n<p><b>Example case 2.</b><br /><br />\nK is 2. There are 25 possible prime numbers of upto 2 digits [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, ...]. N-K is 2. There are 9 possible palindromes of 2 digits: [11, 22, 33, ...]. The total number of possibilities is 25 * 9 = 225. 225 % 1000000007 = 225.<br />\n</p>\n",
