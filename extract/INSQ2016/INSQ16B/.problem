Paaro and Chandramukhi were two best friends. Both of them liked him. On the occassion of his homecoming, both the girls decided to give him a present to impress him.<br><br>\n\nKnowing that Devdas was a coder and he was very fond of palindromic subsequences of a string, Chandramukhi decided to gift him the longest subsequence of Dev's favourite string S which is a palindrome.<br><br>\n\nPaaro somehow got to know Chandramukhi's plan and decided to do something more impressive. She wants to gift a subsequence of the string S, such that all subsequences of the given subsequence is a palindrome. As Paaro is not good with strings, she wants you to tell her how many such subsequences exist in the string S.<br><br>\n\nYou can see the definition of <a href = \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsequence\">subsequence</a> and <a href = \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palindrome\">palindrome</a> by clicking on the links.<br><br>\n\nAs the answer may be very large, output it modulo 10^9+7.\n<br><br>\n\n<font size = 3 > <b>Input</b> </font> <br><br>\nThe first line contains the number of test cases.<br>\nEach test case contains of the single line having string S.<br>\nString S only consists of lowercase alphabets.<br>\n<br>\n\n<font size = 3 > <b>Output</b> </font> <br><br>\nFor each test case output a single line containg the required answer.<br><br>\n\n<font size = 3 > <b>Constraints</b> </font> <br><br>\n1 < T < 100<br>\n1 < |S| < 100<br>\n<br>\n\n<font size = 3 > <b>Example</b> </font> <br><br>\n<font size = 3 > <b>Input:</b> </font> <br><br>\n2<br>\nabcd<br>\naa<br><br>\n<font size = 3 > <b>Output:</b> </font> <br><br>\n4<br>\n3<br>\n<br>\n\n<font size = 3 > <b>Explanation</b> </font> <br><br>\nIn first test cases 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd' are subsequences having all their subsequences as palindromes.<br><br>",
