Unfortunately, the mechanical engineers\nhave not provided a lot of flexibility in movement; indeed, the PropBot can only make two distinct movements.\nIt can either move 10 cm forward, or turn towards the right by 45 degrees. Each of these individual movements\ntakes one second of time.</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>\nYour module has two inputs: the Cartesian coordinates of a point on the plane that the PropBot wants to get as\nclose to as possible, and the maximum number of seconds that can be used to do this. At the beginning of the\nnavigation, the robot is located at the origin, pointed in the +x direction.\nThe number of seconds will be an integer between 0 and 24, inclusive. Both the x and y coordinates of the\ndesired destination point will be a real number between -100 and 100, inclusive.\nThe first entry in the input file will be the number of test cases, t (0 &lt; t &lt; 100). Following this line will\nbe t lines, with each line containing three entries separated by spaces. The first entry will be the number of\nseconds PropBot has to get close to the point. The second entry is the x-coordinate of the point, and the third\nentry is the y-coordinate of the point.</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>Your program must return the distance between the goal point and the closest point the robot can get to within\nthe given time.\nYour result should include at least one digit to the left of the decimal point, and exactly six digits to the right of\nthe decimal point. To eliminate the chance of round off error affecting the results, we have constructed the test\ndata so the seventh digit to the right of the decimal point of the true result is never a 4 or a 5.</p>\n\n<h3>Example</h3>\n\n<pre>\n<b>Input:</b>\n2\n24 5.0 5.0\n9 7.0 17.0\n\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n0.502525\n0.100505\n</pre>",
