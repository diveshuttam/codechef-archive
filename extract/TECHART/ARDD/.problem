He soon realizes what's wrong.  Someone broke a canister of Deodorant in the class, and Prof. Shastri will do anything to break his bones. <br /><br />\n\nSince no one knows who really did it, and it was probably done by someone from outside the class, the students decide to play a game. The loser of that game would have to own up to Prof. Shastri.<br /><br />\nThis wouldn't be a problem if Darshit wasn't on the defaulters list. But he was, and under no circumstances could own up to this messy situation. <br /><br />\nHelp Darshit figure out exactly which person would be the loser in this game.\n\n<h3> The game </h3>\nAll the students would sit on their seats, and their names would be written in a list. Then, one by one, names would be struck off the list. A number between 1 and 5 would be chosen, and the striking would proceed based on that number. The second last person to be struck off the list would have to own up to Prof. Shastri\n<br /><br />\nThis would've been easy if people still had to sit, but most of the class had already picked their seats!\n<br />\n<h3>Note</h3>\nThere will be total 5 sample inputs given to your program. All input values lie between 0 and 120.\n<br />\n<h3>Sample </h3>\nAssuming a class of 7 students\nAnd a random number 3, striking would proceed as follows:\n3,6,2,7,5,1,4 <br /><br />\n\nThus, the first person in the original list of names would be the loser.\n\n<h3>Example Input</h3> (Number of namesXRandom Number)\n<p><br />\n7X3<br />\n5X4<br />\n6X5<br />\n9X2<br />\n3X5<br />\n<h3>Example Output</h3>\n<p>1<br />\n2<br />\n4<br />\n7<br />\n3<br />\n",
