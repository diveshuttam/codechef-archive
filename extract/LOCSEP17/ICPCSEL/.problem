This year\u2019s regionals is getting closer.<br />\nTo select teams for onsite round, a preliminary online round is conducted. <b>N</b> teams have registered \u00a0to participate in this year\u2019s preliminary round, out of which <b>M</b> teams are to be selected for onsite round. </p>\n\n<p>Rules for selection are as follows:<br />\n1. Maximum number of teams from a single institute can not exceed <b>K</b>.<br />\n2. The slots will be filled by selecting top ranking team from each institute according to the ranks in online round.<br />\n3. If slots are still available, the second ranking team from each institute will be selected. This procedure will continue to third ranking teams from each institute (subject to the above constraints) and so on, until vacancy exists. (See examples)</p>\n\n<p>\nGeorge has been given this important task of selecting <b>M</b> teams for onsite round. But he doesn\u2019t know programming and he is too lazy to manually do the selection. So he has asked for your help. You are given the details of N teams which include:<br />\n<b>Hi</b> : Team name of <b>ith</b> team.<br />\n<b>Ci</b> : Institution name of the <b>ith</b> team.<br />\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The first line contains the number of test cases <b>T</b>.<br />\nEach test case starts with three integer <b>N</b>,<b>M</b>,<b>K</b>. <br />\nThe next <b>N</b> lines contains two strings <b>Hi</b> and <b>Ci</b>. </p>\n\n<p><b>Hi</b> and <b>Ci</b> are strings which contains both lowercase and uppercase english alphabets and does not contain spaces.</p>\n\n<p>Teams are ordered in ascending order of their ranking and no two team have the same team name for a given test case.<br />\n\n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n\n<p>For each test case, if it is not possible to select <b>M</b> teams given the above rules, then <b>print \u201cImpossible\u201d</b>. Else print <b>M</b> lines containing the team names of the selected teams. Team name should be printed in ascending order of their ranking, ie top ranked team appear first. <br />\nAfter each test case leave an <b>empty line</b>.<br />\n\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n1 \u2264 <b>T</b> \u2264 10<br />\n1 \u2264 <b>M</b>\u2264 <b>N</b>\u2264 200000<br />\n1\u2264 <b>K</b>\u2264 200<br />\n1\u2264 |<b>Hi</b>|,|<b>Ci</b>|\u2264 20<br />\nSum of <b>N</b> over all test cases\u2264200000</p>\n\n<h3>Subtasks</h3>\n<b>Subtask #1 [40 points]:</b> Sum of <b>N</b> over all test cases\u22641000<br />\n<b>Subtask #2 [60 points]:</b> Original constraints</p>\n\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n2\n11 8 \u00a03\nSpades IITR\nFacelessMen IITK\nRocket IITB\nRandomly ANITS\nCodeTemp IITB\nEncore IITB\nIntuition Amrita\nGap NIT\nComplexity Amrita\nMMM NIT\nZap NIT\n8 6 1\nTriangulation IITR\nFruitSalad DAIICT\nShockers IITM\nSurvivor IITI\nlimitless IIITH\nmaniACs IITR\nRainbow IIITH\nWhiteTigers IITR\n\n<b>Output:</b>\nSpades\nFacelessMen\nRocket\nRandomly\nCodeTemp\nIntuition\nGap\nComplexity\n\n<p>Impossible</p>\n\n<h3>Explanation</h3>\nFor first test case:\nTeams selected in first stage: Spades, FacelessMen,Rocket,Randomly,Intuition,Gap\nTeams selected in second stage: Since there are only 2 slots remaining therefore top 2 teams from different colleges will be selected. -> CodeTemp, Complexity<br />\nFor second test case it is impossible to select 6 teams with at most 1 team per college.\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>\n</p>",
