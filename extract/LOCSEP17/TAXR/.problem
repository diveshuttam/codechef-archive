There are <b>N</b> houses in city numbered from <b>1</b> to <b>N</b>, he lives in house <b>1</b>. These houses are connected to each other by network of <b>N-1</b> road, also Sinchan knows another set of <b>N-1</b> roads which leads to his house from any house. Each road is one way and has unique id labeled from <b>1</b> to <b>2*N-2</b>.<br>Now for naughtiness of Sinchan he has to pay certain toll tax for passing a road, cost may change after passing of Sinchan. Since Sinchan is smart also so he will choose the path through which he has to pay minimum cost while going from house <b>U</b> to house <b>V</b>.<br>\nThere are <b>Q</b> queries describing either toll tax changes for particular road or houses U, V for Sinchan. Help Sinchan to save money.\n\n</p>\n\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>First line contains two integers N and Q. N is number of houses, Q is total queries.</p>\n<p>Next <b>2*N-2</b> line contains three space separated integer  <b>i<sup>th</sup></b>\n of which has <b>U<sub>i</sub> V<sub>i</sub> C<sub>i</sub></b>. Denoting toll tax between house U and V is C and road id is i<b></b>.<br>\n<li>The first <b>N-1</b> line makes network of road which connects all houses without any cycle.</li><li> Next <b>N-1</b> line has <b>V<sub>i</sub></b> equal to 1.</li></p>\n<p>Next Q line contains queries of format.\n\n<li><b>1 K T</b> type 1 query to change toll tax of <b>K<sup>th</sup></b> road to <b>T</b></li>\n<li><b>2 U V</b> type 2 query house U to V Sinchan will travel.</li>\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>For every query of type 2, output minimum cost Sinchan has to pay.</p>\n\n\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<b>2</b> <= <b>N</b> <= <b>200000</b><br>\n<b>1</b> <= <b>Q</b> <= <b>200000</b><br>\n<b>1</b> <= <b>U<sub>i</sub>, V<sub>i</sub> <= <b>N</b><br>\n<b>1</b> <= <b>C<sub>i</sub></b> <= <b>1000000</b><br>\n\n\n<h3>Subtasks</h3>\n<b>Subtask #1 [30 points]:</b> <b>2</b> <= <b>N, Q</b> <= <b>10</b><br>\n<b>Subtask #2 [70 points]:</b> Original constraints<p></p>\n\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n3 3\n1 2 3\n1 3 7\n2 1 2\n3 1 4\n2 1 3\n1 3 1\n2 2 3\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n7\n8\n\n<h3>Explanation</h3>\nQuery 1: Type 2: dist(1,3) = 7\nQuery 2: Type 1: update distance of road 3(2->1) to 1\nQuery 3: Type 2: dist(2,3) = dist(2,1) + dist(1,3) = 1 + 7 = 8\n</pre>",
