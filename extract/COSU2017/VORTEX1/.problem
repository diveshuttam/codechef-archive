The problem is that another guy, Rahul, who also likes the same girl is also present at the wedding. The food is usually served on a round table which can seat <b>N</b> people and he wants to sit next to that girl. Harsh does not want Rahul to sit next to him or the girl. He prays to God for this to happen and suddenly God appears before him. God knows that Harsh is weak at math and in a cruel twist says that HE would make this happen if Harsh tells Him the number of ways in which this can happen. Harsh knows that this is impossible for him to do by himself and so texts you the situation. You, being a programmer, can help Harsh to sit next to the girl of his dreams.(Assume that there are <b>N people</b> at the party and all of them eat together).\nN includes Harsh, Rahul and the girl.\n<br>\nSince the value can be pretty large, print it modulo <b>1000000007</b>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>Input description.</p>\n<p>An integer <b>T</b> is taken as input denoting the number of test cases.\nThen <b>T</b> lines follow, each consisting of an integer <b>N</b>.\n\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>Output description.</p>\nFor each test case, output a single integer value in a new line.\n(The output can be very large numbers!)\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>T</b> \u2264 <b>10<sup>5</sup></b></li>\n<li><b>3</b> \u2264 <b>N</b> \u2264 <b>10<sup>6</sup></b> </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n2\n7\n9<br>\n<b>Output:</b>\n144\n7200",
