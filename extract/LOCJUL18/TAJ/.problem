Each city in the country has a integer code assigned to it. These cities are connected by a system of **N-1** roads. **The city 1 is the capital city. In other words the country is a tree rooted at 1**. Tom lives in city **u** and Jerry in city **v**. One day Tom and Jerry planned to have a business deal at city **w** which is the **common ancestor  of cities u and v farthest from the Capital.**\nThe cost of reaching the **city w** by a person is the **XOR** value of the integer codes of cities visited by that person. So the total cost of the business deal is the **XOR** value of cost of Tom and Jerry reaching **city w**.\n\nYou are given **Q** queries. Each query will have **u and v** and you have to say the final cost of the business deal.\n\n###Input:\n\n- First line will contain **N**, number of cities. \n- Next **N-1** lines contains the details of roads in the city. Each line will have two integers **a and b**, which means city a is connected to b. \n- Next line contains **N** integers, integer **Ai** represents the integer code of city **i**.\n- Next line contains **Q**.\n- Next **Q** lines contains two integers **u and v**.\n\n###Output:\nFor each query output the answer in newline.\n\n###Constraints \n- $1 \\leq N \\leq 10^6$\n- $1 \\leq a,b,u,v \\leq N$\n- $1 \\leq Ai \\leq 10^6$\n- $1 \\leq Q \\leq 10^6$\n\n###Subtasks\n- 30 points : $1 \\leq N,Q \\leq 100$\n- 70 points : $1 \\leq N,Q \\leq 10^6$\n\n\n###Sample Input:\n\t5\n\t1 2\n\t2 3\n\t1 4\n\t4 5\n\t1 2 3 4 5\n\t1\n\t3 5\n###Sample Output:\n\t0",
