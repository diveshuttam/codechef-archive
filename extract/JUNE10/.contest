With great help from our problem setters and tester we have managed to come up with another problem for the contest. The problem \"Stable Marriage\" has been replaced with a new problem \"Tidying Posters\". Hopefully, you will find this one just as exciting as the previous problem.<br />Apologies for the time lost under the given circumstances.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br />Team CodeChef</p> <p>P.S. Thank you everyone for all the co-operation.</p> <p>* Please do not discuss strategy, suggestions or tips in the comments during a live contest. Posting questions clarifying the problem statement is ok. If you are unsure, email us at feedback@codechef.com<br /><br />* Contest problems will become visible on June 1st 2010.<br /><br />* You will receive one point for solving a problem (passing all test cases - no partial credit), regardless of the level of difficulty of that problem.<br /><br />* You can submit solutions as many times as you'd like, there are no penalties for incorrect submissions.<br /><br />* Each contest will have one min/max tie breaker problem, where the best solution will receive one point and all other solutions will receive a fraction based how close they come to the best solution.<br /><br /></p>",
