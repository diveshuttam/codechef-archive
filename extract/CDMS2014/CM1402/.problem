During his time Earth was thought to be a plane with only integer coordinates. But, he didn't have a map. He knew that  the countries are like points located at <b>(int X, int Y)</b>;  The continents had the following properties:</p>\n<li>a continent is a circular region whose center is at <b>(int c1, int c2)</b> and radius is int <b>R</b>; moreover every point (integer coordinate) in a continent is a country.  </li>\n<li>  the continents are separated by oceans such that distance between the center of the continents is at least <b>3</b> times the sum of their radii. </li>\n<p><br />\nGiven the set of all countries on the earth,  the king wants you to help him find the radius of the largest continent.<br />\n<br />\nNote: A continent may contain only a single country.</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The first line contains an integer <b>T</b> denoting the number of test cases.<br />\nFor each test case, the first line contains an integer <b>N</b> denoting the number of countries and the successive N lines contains <b>X</b> and <b>Y</b> values for each of the <b>N</b> countries.\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>For each test case, you have to print a single line containing the radius <b>R</b> of the largest continent.\n</p>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>T</b> \u2264 <b>10</b></li>\n<li><b>-100000</b> \u2264 <b>X,Y</b> \u2264 <b>100000</b></li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n\n2\n19\n-1 1 \n0 1 \n0 2 \n0 0 \n1 1 \n1 2 \n1 3 \n1 0 \n1 -1 \n2 1 \n2 2 \n2 0 \n3 1 \n-5 -9 \n-11 -8 \n-10 -8 \n-10 -7\n-10 -9 \n-9 -8 \n4\n1 0\n-1 0\n0 -1\n0 1\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n\n2\n0\n</pre><p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p>The first test case represent 3 continents of radii 0, 1 and 2 and the second test case represent 4 continents each of radius 0. So, the output i.e, the radius of the largest continent is 2 and 0 for first and second test case respectively.\n</p>\n",
