That is why she appears in most of the programming challenges.<br />\nShe visited NIT Durgapur campus recently and saw some emerging talents in competitive programming. As she is now tired of taking challenges, she is wondering if she could give a challenge to NIT Durgapur students. She is very excited about this and has prepared a challenge for them.<br />\nThere are <b>N</b> forests in Wonderland each having <b>at most one exit point</b> and <b>zero or more entry points</b>. She wants you to design a race track consisting of two or more forests. Start and end point of the track should be in the <b>same forest</b>. As Alice knows that there are many valid tracks possible, she wants you to tell her the length of the longest race track. Print <b>-1</b> if no such race track is possible.\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The first line contains <b>T</b>, the number of test cases.<br />\nEach test case begins with <b>N</b>, the number of forests in Wonderland.<br />\nSecond line of each test case consists <b>N</b> space separated numbers. If <b>i</b>th number is <b>A[i]</b>, then it means exit point of forest <b>i</b> is connected with one of the entry point of forest <b>A[i]</b>. If <b>A[i]</b> is <b>-1</b>, it means there is <b>no exit point</b> in <b>i</b>th forest.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>For each test case, output the length of the longest race track. Print <b>-1</b> if no such race track is possible.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>T</b> \u2264 <b>10</b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>N</b> \u2264 <b>1000000</b></li>\n<li><b>0</b> \u2264 <b>i</b> \u2264 <b>N-1</b></li>\n<li><b>-1</b> \u2264 <b>A[i]</b> \u2264 <b>N-1</b> and <b>A[i] != i</b></li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n1\n23\n4 4 1 4 13 8 8 8 0 8 14 9 15 11 -1 10 15 22 22 22 22 22 21\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n6\n</pre><p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p><img src = \"https://codechef_shared.s3.amazonaws.com/download/HYC/External%20contest%20images/REC2016/0002%20%281%29.jpg\" alt=\"RECIITRK\" /></p>\n<p>\nIn the given example, longest race track is <b>13 -> 11 -> 9 -> 8 -> 0 -> 4 -> 13</b>.\n</p>\n",
