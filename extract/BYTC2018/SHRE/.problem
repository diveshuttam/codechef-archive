He has managed to pass some testcases but has received runtime error on others.\n<br><br>\nHe suspects that one of the parameters p in his program, is the reason for this error. For small values of inputs he is sure that the program will pass, however for large values it doesn't.\n<br>\nHis code is buggy and over 200 lines, so he has decided to find for which values of p it will pass by writing a script and automating the submission process. \n<br><br>\nAssume the program gives runtime error for values of p >= x and correct answer for p < x.\n<br>\nHe will guess a number y, and if p>=y, his program will give up and print nothing, resulting in WA for those testcases. Note that if his guess y>x he will still get runtime error on few cases.\n<br><br>\nHe is tired of Runtime Error, so he doesn't want more than k Runtime Error submissions. He is fine with WA though.\n<br>\nYou are given n, Shreehari's upper bound for x (i.e. for p>n he knows his program gives RE), and k, the number of runtime error submissions, he is able to tolerate.\n<br><br>\nYour task is to find the minimum number of submissions he needs to make in order to find the least value of p for which his program will fail.</p>\n<p></p>\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The first line contains the number of testcases T\n<br>\nEach of the next T lines contain two space separated integers n and k denoting the maximum value of parameter p and the maximum number of Runtime Error submissions Shreehari is able to tolerate.</p>\n<p></p>\n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>Output T lines , in each line the answer to the corresponding testcase,\ni.e The minimum number of submissions Shreehari will need to make in order to find the value of P for which his program fails.\n<br>\nNote that it is possible that the program gives RE for p=1 and does not give RE for p=n.</p>\n<p></p>\n\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n1 \\leq T \\leq 10^5\n1 \\leq n,k \\leq 10^5\n<ul>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>T</b> \u2264 <b>10^5</b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>n, k</b> \u2264 <b>10^5</b></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Should contain all the constraints on the input data that you may have.
