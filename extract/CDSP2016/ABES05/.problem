The length of the roads are same and at the end of each road there is a bus stand.So he wants to calculate total bus stands between his school and home at the longest path. </p>\n<p>Please help help to find longest distance.</p>\n\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The first line of the input contains an integer <b>T</b> denoting the number of test cases. The description of <b>T</b> test cases follows.</p>\n<p>The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers <b>N</b> and <b>M</b>, denoting the number of bus stands and the number of directed roads.</p>\n<p>The next <b>M</b> lines contain two space-separated integers <b>a</b><sub>i</sub> and <b>b</b><sub>i</sub>, denoting the path from <b>a</b><sub>i</sub> to <b>b</b><sub>i</sub>.</p>\n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>For each test case output a single integer which denotes the total number of bus stand between his home and school </p>\n\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>1 \u2264 T \u2264 10</li>\n<li>2 \u2264 N \u2264 1000</li>\n<li>N-1 \u2264 M \u2264 10<sup>6</sup></li>\n<li>The sum of N over all test cases in a single test file does not exceed 10<sup>4</sub></li>\n<li>The sum of M over all test cases in a single test file does not exceed 10<sub>6</sub></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n2\n5 6\n1 3 \n1 2\n3 4\n2 4\n2 5\n4 5\n5 7\n1 3\n1 2 \n3 2\n3 4\n2 4\n4 5\n2 5\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n2 \n3\n</pre>\n\n<h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p><b>Example case 1.</b> </p>\n<p>Longest path 1->2->4->5 or  1->3->4->5.
