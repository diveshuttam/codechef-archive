He thought the question is very tough to solve manually therefore he decided to take help of a friend who can code the solution. Since you are the only friend of Ram who can code, he asks for your help.<br/><br/>\n\nQusetion is to find the Handsome number, Handsome number is a <b>largest</b> number made up of only digits <b>2,3 and 5</b> such that the count for each digit is divisible by the number obtained by multiplication of remaining two digits. You are provided with the number N and you have to output the handsome number of N digits. If no handsome number exist for the given N output -1.<br/><br/>\n\nSince most of the students have already solved the question and moved to next round, so help Ram answer the question as soon as possible. <br/><br/>\n\n</p>\n\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>First line of the input contains an integer <b>T</b> denoting number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. The only line of each test case contains the integer <b>N</b> denoting the length of Handsome Number.</p>\n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>For each test case output the Handsome number or -1 if no Handsome Number exist.</p>\n\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>T</b> \u2264 <b>50</b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>N</b> \u2264 <b>100000</b></li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n\n3\n4\n6\n16\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n\n-1\n555555\n5555553333333333\n\n</pre>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p><b>Example case 1.</b> ...</p>\n\nThere is no handsome number of length 4.<br/><br/>\n<p><b>Example case 2.</b> ...</p>\n\n555555 is the Handsome Number of length 6. Since, count of 5 is 6 which is divisible by (2*3) and the number is also largest among all other such number of length 6.<br/><br/>\n\n<p><b>Example case 3.</b> ...</p>\n\n5555553333333333 is the Handsome Number of length 16. Since, count of 5 is 6 which is divisible by (2*3) and the count of 3 is 10 which is divisible by (5*2), and the number is also  largest among all other such number of length 16. \n\n",
