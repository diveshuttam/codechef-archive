He wanted to erect a 100ft golden statue of himself and he looted gold from several places for this. He even looted his own people, by using the following unfair strategy:</p>\n<p>There are <b>N</b> houses in Maahishmati, and the <b>i<sup>th</sup></b> house has <b>A<sub>i</sub></b> gold plates. Each gold plate costs exactly 1 <b>Nimbda</b>, which is the unit of currency in the kingdom of Maahishmati. Bhallaladeva would choose an integer <b>K</b>, and loots all the houses in several steps. In each step:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>He would choose a house <b>i</b> which hasn't been looted yet, pay the owner exactly <b>A<sub>i</sub></b> Nimbdas, and take away all the gold plates in that house (Hence, he also ends up looting this house).</li>\n<li>He would now choose <b>atmost K</b> houses which haven't been looted yet and take away all the gold plates from these houses without paying a single Nimbda (Yes, he takes all of them for free).\n</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>He repeats the above steps until all the <b>N</b> houses have been looted. Your task is to devise a strategy for Bhallaladeva to loot the houses in some order, so that the number of nimbdas he has to pay is <b>minimium</b>. You'll also be given multiple values of <b>K</b> (<b>Q</b> of them to be precise), and you need to find the minimum number of nimbdas for each of these values.</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The first line of input consists of a single integer <b>N</b> denoting the number of houses in Maahishmati. The second line of input consists of <b>N</b> space separated integers denoting <b>A<sub>1</sub>, A<sub>2</sub>, ..., A<sub>N</sub></b>, where <b>A<sub>i</sub></b> denotes the number of gold plates in the <b>i<sup>th</sup></b> house. The third line of input consists of a single integer <b>Q</b> denoting the number of values of <b>K</b> to follow. Each of the following <b>Q</b> lines consist of a single integer, where the value on the <b>i<sup>th</sup></b> line denotes the value of K for the <b>i<sup>th</sup></b> query.\n</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>Output exactly <b>Q</b> integers on separate lines, where the output on the <b>i<sup>th</sup></b> line denotes the answer for the <b>i<sup>th</sup></b> value of <b>K</b>.</p>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>N</b> \u2264 <b>10<sup>5</sup></b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>Q</b> \u2264 <b>10<sup>5</sup></b></li>\n<li><b>0</b> \u2264 <b>K</b> \u2264 <b>N-1</b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>A<sub>i</sub></b> \u2264 <b>10<sup>4</sup></b></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n4\n3 2 1 4\n2\n0\n2\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n10\n3\n</pre><h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p><b>For the first query</b>, <b>K = 0</b>. Hence, Bhallaladeva cannot take gold plates from any of the houses for free. It will cost him 3 + 2 + 1 + 4 = <b>10</b> nimbdas.</p>\n<p><b>For the second query</b>, <b>K = 2</b>. In the first step Bhallaladeva can pay <b>2</b> nimbdas for gold plates in house number 2, and take the gold in houses 1 and 4 for free (Note that house 1 has 3 gold plates and house 4 has 4 gold plates). Now, he has looted houses 1, 2 &amp; 4. Now in the second step, he loots house 3, by paying <b>1</b> nimbda. Hence, the total cost = 1 + 2 = <b>3</b>. Note that there might be multiple ways to achieve the minimum cost, and we have explained only one of them.</p>\n",
