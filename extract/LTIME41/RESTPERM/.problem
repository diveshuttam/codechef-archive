Especially Sergey. So he asked Alex for some nice problem they can think about to dispel the boredom. And Alex told the following problem:</p>\n\n<p>There is an <b>1</b>-indexed permutation <b>A</b> of the first <b>N</b> positive integers, which is not known. You can ask two following kinds of queries:\n<ul>\n<li><b>1 X Y D</b> : is it true that |<b>A<sub>X</sub> - A<sub>Y</sub></b>| is divisible by <b>D</b> without remainder?</li>\n<li><b>2 X Y</b> : is it true that <b>A<sub>X</sub> < A<sub>Y</sub></b></li>\n</ul>\nThe task was to restore the permutation <b>A</b> by asking the queries of the following form. There are limits on the amount of queries of each type you can ask.\n</p>\n\n<p>Andrew and Kostya came up with the solution very quickly. But Sergey was really puzzled with this task. However, after thinking for some time, he came up with a solution too.</p>\n\n<p>And then he figured out that he actually misheard the original problem that was a really easy one. </p>\n\n<p>First Sergey got upset because of spending time for solving the non-existing problem, but then he realized that he can give this problem in a contest.</p>\n\n<p>So he proposes to solve his version of the problem. :)</p>\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The first line of the input contains an integer <b>T</b> denoting the number of test cases. The description of <b>T</b> test cases follows.</p>\n<p>The first (and only) line of each test case contains a single integer <b>N</b> denoting the number of numbers in the permutation.</p>\n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>For each test case, output <b>Q</b> lines.</p>\n\n<p>On every of these <b>Q</b> output first the type of the query, then the parameters, separated with single spaces. There can be three possible query types: the first two with the same format from the statement and the following one:<ul>\n<li><b>3 A<sub>1</sub> A<sub>2</sub> ... A<sub>N</sub></b> denoting the resulting permutation.</li>\n</ul>\nThere should always be only one query of the third type per test case -- the last one.</p>\n<p>For the queries (types <b>1</b> and <b>2</b>) you output, you will receive a feedback. The judge program will output \"Yes\" or \"No\" (both without quotes), denoting the answer to the corresponding query.</p>\n<p>In a test case, you can ask no more than <b>13 \u00d7 N</b> queries of the first type and no more than <b>N-1</b> queries of the second type. It is guaranteed that it will be possible to restore the permutation under the given constraints.</p>\n<p>Please flush output buffer anytime you output a query.</p>\n\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>1 \u2264</b> sum of <b>N \u2264 10<sup>5</sup></b></li>\n<li><b>1 \u2264</b> <b>X, Y, D</b> \u2264 <b>N</b></li>\n<li>Subtask 1 (16 points): <b>1 \u2264</b> <b>N \u2264 3</b></li>\n<li>Subtask 2 (25 points): <b>1 \u2264</b> <b>N \u2264 13</b></li>\n<li>Subtask 3 (30 points): <b>1 \u2264</b> <b>N \u2264 100</b></li>\n<li>Subtask 4 (29 points): <b>1 \u2264</b> <b>N \u2264 10<sup>4</sup></b></li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n<tt>2\n2\n2</tt>\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n<tt>2 1 2\n> (FEEDBACK) No\n3 2 1\n2 1 2\n> (FEEDBACK) Yes\n3 1 2</tt>\n</pre>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n",
