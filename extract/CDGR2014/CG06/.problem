The difference here is that different rules are used for different letters and the counting process starts where the last letter ends. Using the numerical value of each letter (A=1, B=2, \u2026 Z= 26) the rules are as follows: The number of letters to count is given by: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>RULE 1 \tMultiply its numerical value by 2 </li>\n<li>RULE 2 \tDivide its numerical value by 3. Multiply the integer remainder by 5 </li>\n<li>RULE 3 \tDivide its numerical value by 4. Multiply the integer part of the quotient by \u20138. </li>\n<li>RULE 4 \tTake the square root of the numerical value. Truncate the decimal part of the answer. Multiply the resulting integer by \u201312. </li>\n<li>RULE 5 \tFind the sum of the factors of its numerical value. Multiply by 10. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>For the first letter of each set, if the computed value is non-negative, starting at A count the computed value to the right. For each additional letter start at the current encoded letter. If the first computed value is negative, starting at A count to the left which means wrapping around to the end of the alphabet. For each additional letter start at the current encoded letter. As an example, the input C1B2F3$ would produce the encoded letters GQI. The C with a numerical value of 3 evaluates to a 6, using rule 1. Always starting each new set at A, and counting 6 letters to the right, the C encodes to an G. The B with a numerical value of 2 evaluates to a 10. Counting down the alphabet 10 letters from G encodes the B to a Q. The F with a numerical value of 6 evaluates to a \u20138, using rule 3. Counting to the left 8 letters from Q encodes the F to an I. The final encoded value is GQI.\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The first line of input file contains positive integer t \u2013 the amount of test cases.
