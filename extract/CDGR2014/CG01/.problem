He opened the 1st box, it was empty while in the second, there was 3 piles of gold coins. Whenever he chooses a pile of Y coins (y>=1)  from 2nd box, the coins in the 1st box increases by Y but only one gold coin gets reduced from the pile in the 2nd box. He can choose one pile at a<br />\ntime. He repeats the operation N times.  Each pile will contain coins between 1 and 50, inclusive, initially.<br />\nFind the maximum gold coins he can take with him.\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The first line of input consists of T, the number of test cases. Exactly t test cases follow.<br />\nSecond line of input consists of number of coins in the three piles respectively, separated by space. Third line of input consist of a single integer N.\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>Single line consisting of maximum coins he can take.</p>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<p>1&lt;=T&lt;=100<br />1&lt;=N&lt;=150</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:\n1\n3 7 6\n3\n</b>\n<b>Output:\n19</b>\n</pre><p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p><b>The three numbers are (3, 7, 6). One possible optimal strategy is as follows:<br />\nChini chooses 7. he gains 7 points, and the numbers become (3, 6, 6). Chini chooses 6. he gains 6 points, and the numbers become (3, 6, 5). Chini chooses 6. he gains 6 points, and the numbers become (3, 5, 5).<br />\n</b></p>\n",
