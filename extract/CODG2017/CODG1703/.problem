They have opened a poultry farm starting off with just 1 hen on day 1. Now these are some special kind of hens. These hens give birth to <b>K</b> little hens every day. But lately, Naveen has observed that the hens are mysteriously dying at the end of the <b>L<sup>th</sup> day</b> after its birth. \n<br>\nAs it has turned out that its dungeon_master behind the deaths of hens, Jeetu and Yogi are out to teach dungeon_master another lesson. \n<br>\nSo Naveen has asked you, Mandal, to figure out how many hens they will be left with on any given day?\n</p>\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>\nFirst line of input contains an integer <b>T</b>, denoting the number of test cases.<br>\nFirst line of each test case contains three space separated integers <b>K</b>, <b>L</b> and <b>N</b> denoting number of little hens given by each hen, life cycle of each hen and the day on which you have to find the total number of hens alive respectively.<br>\n</p>\n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>\nFor each test case, you have to print the <b>count of hens alive</b> on the given day.\n<br>\nYou have to print your answer <b>modulo 10<sup>9</sup> + 7</b>.\n</p>\n\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<p>\n<b>1</b> \u2264 <b>T</b> \u2264 <b>5*10<sup>6</sup></b><br>\n<b>1</b> \u2264 <b>K</b> \u2264 <b>5</b><br>\n<b>1</b> \u2264 <b>L</b> \u2264 <b>5</b><br>\n<b>1</b> \u2264 <b>N</b> \u2264 <b>25</b><br>\n</p>\n\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n2\n2 3 3\n1 2 3\n\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n9\n2\n<br>\n</pre>\n\n<p>\n<b>Explanation</b>\n<br>\n<b>Test Case 1 :</b><br>\nInitially there is just 1 hen. Next day this hen gives birth to 2 new hens. On the 3rd day each of these 3 hens give birth to 2 new hens. Total hens on 3rd day are 9.\n<br>\n<b>Test Case 2 : </b><br> \nInitially there is 1 hen. Next day this hen gives birth to 1 new hen. So the total hens on the 2nd day is 2 . \n<br>\nOn the 3rd day there is just 1 hen left in the farm according to the condition. This 1 hen gives birth to 1 new hen. So Total hens = 2.\n\u00a0</p> \n",
