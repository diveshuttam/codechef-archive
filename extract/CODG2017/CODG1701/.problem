They learned that prime numbers are those which have exactly 2 factors (1 and the number itself). \nIt is this thing about the little children at KOSHISH that they are really smart. Anurag knew that they can solve problems related to Prime Numbers quite easily. \nTo pose a challenge to the children (since they love challenges), he <b>tweaked the definition of Prime Numbers</b> a little. He named them <b>T-Primes</b>. \n<br><br>\nAccording to the new definition, <b>T-Primes</b> are the numbers which have <b>exactly 3 distinct</b> (not 2) factors. Anurag asked the children to write a program (they are smart you know!) to check if a given number is T-Prime or not. \nWith adrenaline rushing, the children went to solve the problem and came next day with a completely valid running program. (I told you they are smart!)<br> \nCan you tell how they managed to crack this one?\n\n</p>\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>\u2022  First line of the input contains an integer <b>T</b>, denoting number of test case.<br>\n\u2022  The only line of each test case contains an integer <b>N</b><br>\n</p>\n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>\u2022\t For each test case, you have to print \"Yes\" if the given N is T-Prime otherwise \"No\" (without quotes).</p>\n\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<p>\n<b>1</b> \u2264 <b>T</b> \u2264 <b>10<sup>6</sup></b><br>\n<b>0</b> \u2264 <b>N</b> \u2264 <b>10<sup>12</sup></b><br>\n</p>\n\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n3\n2\n9\n15\n\n<b>Output:</b>\nNo\nYes\nNo\n</pre>",
