His first step is to figure out the location where Swati might have lost her bag. Mr. Holmes have a secret underground group of detectives. One among them is Shubham. Now the city of Knitwille is such spread that it\u2019s just a long single straight line road across which the entire city sprawls. So Swati must have travelled in this same <b>long straight line road</b>. Sherlock asks Shubham to trace back the locations where Swati must have stopped in the duration of her outing. Shubham brings up a <b>list of points</b> on the roads where Swati stopped during her outing. \n<br><br>\nRest of the Sherlock\u2019s underground team lead by Chatur is such spread onto the straight road that each of them have an operational region defined by a <b>segment</b> on the road. Such segments on the road <b>maybe overlapping, non-overlapping or partially overlapping</b>.\n<br>\nAtul, one of the top-most underground detective brings this list of regions of operations in the form of <b>segments</b> defined by a starting point and an ending point on the road (both inclusive).\n<br>\nSo the step 2 is to figure out in how many of the operational regions, each of her location points lie.\n</p>\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>\nThe first line of the input contains two space separated integers <b>K</b> and <b>L</b> denoting number of regions and number of location points.\n<br><br>\nNext K lines contain two space separated integers <b>x<sub>i</sub></x></b> and <b>y<sub>i</sub></b> denoting the i-th region.\n<br>\nNext L lines contains <b>L</b> space-separated integers <b>l<sub>1</sub></b>, <b>l<sub>2</sub></b>, ..., <b>l<sub>L</sub></b> denoting the location points.\n</p>\n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>\nThe Output should contain a single line containing L space separated integers, i-th of which denotes the number of segments in which location l<sub>i</sub> falls.</li>\n<p>\n\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<p>\n<b>1</b> \u2264 <b>K, L</b> \u2264 <b>5 x 10<sup>4</sup></b><br>\n<b>-10<sup>8</sup></b> \u2264 <b>x<sub>i</sub> \u2264 y<sub>i</sub></b> \u2264 <b>10<sup>8</sup></b><br>\n</p>\n\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre>\n<b>Input:</b>\n2 3\n-4 3\n1 5\n2 -3 4\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n2 1 1 \n\n</pre>\n<br><br>\n<h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p>\n<b>Example case 1.</b>\n<br>\nLocation point 2 lies in two regions defined by [-4, 3] and [1, 5]. Point -3 falls in just one region [-4, 3] and point 4 also falls in just 1 region.\n</p>",
