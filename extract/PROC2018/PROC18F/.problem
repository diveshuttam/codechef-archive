He has prepared an extraordinary magic trick which he calls as the biggest achievement of his life. He will be performing this magic trick for the first time in the $\\text{K}$-Pop World Festival. He is nervous and wants to make sure that everything goes well. His magic trick consists of $\\text{N}$ acts labeled from 1 to N. Every act except act 1 is $\\text{directly}$ dependent upon the successful execution of exactly one of the previous acts. The act i is said to be dependent upon act j iff - \n- act i is directly dependent upon the act j (j < i) or\n- act i is dependent upon some act x which is dependent upon the act j. (j < x < i) \n\nAn act can never happen if one or more of its dependencies failed. Note that $\\text{not happening is not the same as failing}$. Also, every act has an associated value $\\mathbf{a_i}$ which gets added to the audience's anger if that act $\\text{fails}$. If the anger becomes very large, people will start throwing sharp objects at Niket. \n\nSince he is going to perform in the $\\text{K}$-Pop World Festival, he is interested in knowing the minimum possible anger value of audience in the hypothetical situation where he was able to successfully execute $\\text{exactly K}$ acts during his performance. This means that the remaining acts either failed or could not happen (because of the dependency constraints).\n\n###Input\nThe first line contains a single interger $\\text{T}$ - the number of testcases.\n\nFor each testcase,\n\nThe first line contains two space separated integers $\\text{N}$ and $\\text{K}$.\n\nThe following N-1 lines contain the information about the acts 2 to N. ith of these lines contains two space separated integers $p_i$ ($p_i$ < i+1) and $a_i$- This means that the (i+1)th act is directly dependent upon the $p_i$th act and adds $a_i$ to the anger value.\n\n###Output\nFor each testcase, print a line containing the minimum anger value of audience if Niket could perform exactly $\\text{K}$ of the acts successfully.\n\n###Constraints \n$1 \\leq \\text{T} \\leq 10$\n\n$1 \\leq \\text{N} \\leq 2000$ \n\n$1 \\leq \\text{K} \\leq \\text{N}$ \n\n$1 \\leq \\mathbf{a_i} \\leq 10^9$ \n\n###Sample Input\n\t1\n\t5 3\n\t1 5\n\t2 4\n\t2 6\n\t3 8\n\n###Sample Output\n\t4\n\n###Explanation\nIf Niket fails on act 3,  $a_3$ = 4 gets added to the audience's anger and the act 5 can never happen. This means only 3 acts 1,2 and 4 are successful.",
