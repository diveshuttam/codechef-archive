An arbitrary order of numbers is likely to contain many \u201cinversions\u201d,that is, a large number ahead of a smaller one, and our algorithm is a primitive procedure for seeking out inversions and undoing them,one at a time until they are gone.<br/></br/></p>\n<p>Beginning with a given order <b>r1,r2,........,rn</b> the inversions are sought out by comparing the numbers in the first two places (r1,r2), then the pair in position 2 and 3, followed by the pair in position 3 and 4,and so on.Whenever an inversion is found, one simply undoes it and proceeds to the succeeding pair of positions.Such a \u201cbubble pass\u201d clearly does not skip over last number,but carries it along until it is displaced by even bigger number.Thus, on the first pass, the greatest number is picked up somewhere along the way and carried right to the end ;in the second pass, the next biggest number is carried to the second last place and so forth.Of course many inversions are incidentally undone along the way as the big numbers are piled up at the end.<br/></br/></p>\n<p>Now consider the same sequence as above <b>r1,r2,r3\u2026\u2026.rN</b> with random arrangement of <b>N</b> different numbers.What is the probability that rM where <b>M&lt;=N</b> forward to the end up in position <b>K</b> after the first bubble sort pass where <b>M&lt;=K&lt;=N</b>. </p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>Input description.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The first line of the input contains an integer <b>T</b> denoting the number of test cases. The description of <b>T</b> test cases follows</li>\n<li>Each of the test case is denoted by three space separated integers <b>N</b>,<b>M</b> and <b>K</b>.\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>Output description.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>For each test case, output a single line containing a single value accurate up to six places of decimal.\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>T</b> \u2264 <b>1000</b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>N,M,K</b> \u2264 <b>10^3</b></li>\n<li><b>M</b> \u2264 <b>K</b> \u2264 <b>N</b></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n2\n8 2 3\n40 20 30\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n0.083333\n0.001075269\n\n</pre>\n",
