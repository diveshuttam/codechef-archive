Felicity did a great job and tracked down the danger value of each room of the factory where Vertigo was being synthesized to be circulated in glades. Arrow decided to experiment with his weapons and decided to  carry with him <b>K</b> special electric arrows[a actual arrow] capable of completely destroying the room when fired and setting the adjoining rooms to fire till either it is a last room i.e edge room or already destroyed room is encountered. To save the room the Vertigo synthesizers must use same number of units of a special liquid as the damage value of room. Felicity also gave the room number of those rooms which were weak spots. But unfortunately Felicity went missing under mysterious circumstances. So Arrow now requests you to help save the Starling City by finding the order in which he should destroy the rooms to inflict maximum damage i.e make them use maximum amount of special liquid.\n </p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>Input description.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The first line of the input contains an integer <b>T</b> denoting the number of test cases. The description of <b>T</b> test cases follows.\"</li>\n<li>The first line contains two numbers <b>N</b>(total number of rooms) and <b>K</b>(total number of arrows Arrow carries along which need to be fired on the k weak rooms in factory).</li>\n<li>For each room next line contains <b>N</b> numbers representing damage value</li>\n<li> Next line contains k number/index of weak rooms in the factory</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>Output description.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>For each test case, output a single line containing the maximum damage (i.e make enemy use maximum units of special liquid) that can be done to the factory.\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>T</b> \u2264 <b>100</b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>N</b> \u2264 <b>100</b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>K</b> \u2264 <b>50</b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>Damage Value</b> \u2264 <b>100</b></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n1\n8 2\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\n3 6\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n66\n</pre>\n<h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p><b>Example case 1.<br/></br/></b><br />\nArrow has two choices, one to destro 3 first followed by 6 and vice a versa. If he destroys 3 first he gets 66 and if 6 first he gets 51. So 66 is the correct answer.\n</p>\n",
