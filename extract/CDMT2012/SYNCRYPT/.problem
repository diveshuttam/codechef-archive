These messages are very important as they contain the acts which they are going to perform so they encode it using Synoquote a techniquie the devised  so no rival carnival can read them.<br />\nA Synoquote is a simple encoded message where one letter is simply replaced by another\nthroughout the message.<br /> For example:<br />\nEncoded: FDY GAI BG UKMY<br />\nDecoded: THE SKY IS BLUE<br />\n\nBut being clowns they are very confused on how to decode these messages so kindly help them.\n<br/></p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The first line of input contains a single integer N, (0 < N <1001) which is the number of test cases  that\nfollow. Each testcase consists of two lines of input. The first line is the encoded message. The\nsecond line is a 26 character string of upper case letters giving the character mapping for each letter\nof the alphabet: the first character gives the mapping for A, the second for B and so on. Only upper\ncase letters will be used. Spaces may appear in the encoded message, and should be preserved in\nthe output string.</p>\n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>For each testcase, you should generate one line of output with the following values: The data set\nnumber as a decimal integer (start counting at one), a space and the decoded message.\n\n<h3>Example</h3>\n\n<pre>\n<b>Input:</b>\nFDY GAI BG UKMY\nKIMHOTSQYRLCUZPAGWJNBVDXEF\n\n<b>Output:</b>\nTHE SKY IS BLUE\n</pre>\n",
