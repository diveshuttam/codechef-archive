One of the aims of this monthly contest is to create awareness about the competitive programming and problem solving among the school students. While the focus is on the students in Kerala, anybody who is interested in coding can participate in the contest. The contest is conducted on CodeChef every month. Contest spans over three days \u2013 Friday through Sunday. The contest will focus on problem solving rather than direct implementation of the programming language syntax and built in functions.</li>\r\n<li><b>Organizer: </b>The contest is hosted by Amrita University in association with CodeChef.</li>\r\n<li><b>Registrations for prizes: </b><a href=\"https://goo.gl/ad828C\" target=\"_blank\">https://goo.gl/ad828C</a> (only for Kerala students),\u00a0<a href=\"https://goo.gl/Uoh6zM\" target=\"_blank\">https://goo.gl/Uoh6zM</a> (for Indian participants)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</div>\r\n<p><b class=\"rules-heading\" style=\"color: #444444; font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 23px;\">Contest Details:</b></p>\r\n<div class=\"rules-body\">\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><b>Duration: </b>3\u00a0days</li>\r\n<li><b>Start time: </b>28th\u00a0July 2017, 00:00 hrs IST</li>\r\n<li><b>End time: </b>30th July 2017, 23:59 hrs IST.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</div>\r\n<p><b class=\"rules-heading\" style=\"color: #444444; font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 23px;\">Eligibility Criteria: Anyone with a knack for Programming :P</b></p>\r\n<div class=\"rules-body\">\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 23px; font-size: 13px;\">Please go through this\u00a0<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://loc.amrita.ac.in/?page_id=34\">link</a> to know the eligibility criteria.
