Each checkpoint have been assigned a character from <b>'a' - 'z' </b>(lower case alphabets).\nHe was there at the starting of the bridge and the money Bag was there at the end. Any how he wants to reach at the end of the \nbridge. At each checkpoint a guard was there so he has to pay them to move forward. But the payment scheme was a little different \nthan the normal. From a checkpoint Santa can only move to the next checkpoint or to any checkpoint with the same character \nassigned(only in forward direction). The cost that the guard will take is the absolute difference of their ascii values.\nSo you have to help Santa in order to find the minimum amount of money, he should start with in order to reach at the end.\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The first line contains an integer <b>T</b> denoting the number of test cases. The description of <b>T</b> test cases follows. <br><ul>\n</ul>\n<p> A string is given in a new line of length N. <br></p>\n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>For each test case, output a single line containing the minimum amount of money which Santa needs to have at the beginning. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>T</b> \u2264 <b>10</b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>N</b> \u2264 <b>100000</b></li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n1\nabcdefac\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n2\n</pre>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p><b>Example case 1.</b>Assuming the string to be 1 indexed, From 1st index Santa jumped to  7th index and the  cost required is  0 and then from 7th index to the last with cost abs(99-97) = 2 <br>Total cost required = 0 +2 = 2</p>",
