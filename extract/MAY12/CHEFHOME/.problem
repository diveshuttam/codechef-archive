    "body": "<span class=\"solution-visible-txt\">All submissions for this problem are available.</span><p>\nOur hardworking chef is bored of sleeping in his restaurants. He has decided to settle down. The first thing he must do is to find a suitable location to build a palatial home.\n</p>\n<p>\nThink of the city as a two-dimensional grid. There are <b> N </b> restaurants in the city. Each of the chef's restaurant is a point denoted by (<b>X</b> , <b>Y</b>). A <b>house</b> can be located at a grid point (<b>R</b>, <b>S</b>)  if the sum of the distances between this point and each of the restaurants is as small as possible. Find the number of possible house locations in the city to help out chef build a home.\n</p>\n<p>\nMore than one restaurant can be located at the same point. <br />\nHouses and restaurants can be located at the same point. <br />\nEvery house must have integer co-ordinates. In other words, <b>R</b> and <b>S</b> are integers. <br />\nThe distance between two points (A,B) and (C,D)  is |A-C| + |B-D|. Here |X| is the absolute function. \n</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>\nFirst line in the input contains <b>T</b>, number of test cases. <br />\nFirst line of each test case contains <b>N</b>, number of restaurants.<br />\nEach of the next <b>N</b> lines contain two integers <b>X</b> and <b>Y</b> separated by a space.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>T</b> &lt;= 100 <br />\n<b> N </b> &lt;= 10^3 <br />\n-10^8 &lt;= <b>X</b> &lt;=10^8 <br />\n-10^8 &lt;= <b>Y</b> &lt;=10^8 \n</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>\nThe number of possible locations (grid points) where houses can be built.</p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre>\n<b>Input:</b>\n3\n5\n0 0\n-1 0\n1 0\n0 1\n0 -1\n5\n31 11\n30 -41\n20 14\n25 18\n25 38\n2\n0 0\n1 1\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n1\n1\n4\n</pre>",
