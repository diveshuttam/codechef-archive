Each test case generated by the below method.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n<strong>N</strong>, <strong>M</strong> and <strong>P</strong><sub><strong>i</strong>,<strong>j</strong></sub> are chosen uniformly at random such that they satisfy constraints.\nAfter that, each <strong>P</strong><sub><strong>i</strong>,<strong>j</strong></sub> becomes 0 with the probability 0.75.\nThen an integer <strong>x</strong> is chosen from the set {1, 2, 5, 10, 100} uniformly at random.\nFor each <strong>j</strong> (1 &le; <strong>j</strong> &le; <strong>M</strong>), \na real number <strong>y</strong><sub><strong>j</strong></sub> is chosen from [0, 1) uniformly at random, \nand <strong>C</strong><sub><strong>j</strong></sub> is set at (<strong>x</strong> + <strong>y</strong><sub><strong>j</strong></sub>) * (<strong>P</strong><sub>1,<strong>j</strong></sub> + <strong>P</strong><sub>2,<strong>j</strong></sub> + ... + <strong>P</strong><sub><strong>N</strong>,<strong>j</strong></sub>) rounded to the nearest integer.\nIf <strong>C<sub>j</sub></strong> is less than 1, then <strong>C<sub>j</sub></strong> becomes 1.\nIf <strong>C<sub>j</sub></strong> is more than 1000000, then <strong>C<sub>j</sub></strong> becomes 1000000.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nFinally, if the generated case does not satisfy the constraint \"The probability of killing the <strong>i</strong>-th G is at least 90% for all <strong>i</strong>, if Ciel buys all insecticides\", this case is destroyed and do the above process once again.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nA test case generator is available <a href=\"http://www.codechef.com/download/CKROACH_generator.c\">here</a>.\n</p>\n\n\n<h3>Sample Input</h3>\n<pre>2\n2 3\n100 100 190\n90 0 90\n0 90 90\n1 5\n10 20 40 60 85\n10 20 40 60 85\n</pre>\n\n<h3>Sample Output</h3>\n<pre>1\n3\n2\n3 5</pre>\n\n<h3>Output details</h3>\n<p>\nIn the first case, the third insecticide will kill the <strong>i</strong>-th G with probability 90% for all <strong>i</strong>.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn the second case, after using the third and fifth insecticides,\nG is still alive with the probability (1 - 40/100) * (1 - 85/100) = 0.6 * 0.15 = 0.09.\nTherefore the set of the third and fifth insecticides will kill the G with the probability 91%.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe output for Sample Input of <a href=\"http://www.codechef.com/download/CKROACH_simplesolution.c\">CKROACH_simplesolution.c</a> is the following.
