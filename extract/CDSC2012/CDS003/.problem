They both were on level 19. After trying too hard both of them could not decipher the nonsense, so they decided to play alongside. Sheldon Cooper had to pass a message to Barney Stinson. So he decided to convert each letter of the sentence to their corresponding to their ASCII codes. When Barney received the message he could not get anything. Now you have to design a code which converts the encrypted message to readable format.\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The input will consist of the first line containing the number of test cases &lsquo;n&rsquo; followed by n lines of test cases.\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>\nFor each input print the decoded line.\n<h3>Example</h3>\n\n<pre>\n<b>Input:</b>\n2\n721011081081113287111114108100\n871011089911110910132116111327311010010597\n\n\n<b>Output:</b>\nHello World\nWelcome to India\n\n</pre>",
