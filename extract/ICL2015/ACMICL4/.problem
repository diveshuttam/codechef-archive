Currently his team is on top of the leader board. But this contest is going to be close as all has come down to this last question.<br />\nIn this Daman and his team need to crack a random number generator. (Note:- A random generator produces the same result of same seed). <br/><br />\nDaman and his team are really busy trying to write a random generator of their own that replicates the one in the contest. They also want to automate testing whether their guess is correct or not. But they are running out of time and they need a program to match accuracy of their random generator to that of the one used in the contest.<br/><br />\nKnowing your programming capabilities Daman has turned to you for help. He wants you to write a program that gives the maximum length of matching sequence in the numbers generated by both the random generators. <br/><br />\nAlso it is known that the random generator will generate at-most K numbers and all would be LESS THAN or EQUAL to N. Every number can occur at-most once. </br/></br/></br/></p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The first line of the input contains an integer <b>T</b> denoting the number of test cases. <br/>The description of <b>T</b> test cases follows.</br/></li>\n<li>The first line of each testcase contains two integers denoting <b>N</b> and <b>K</b> respectively. <br/>Second line contains K integers(separated by space) generated by random generator used in contest.<br/>Third line contains K integers (separated by space) generated by random generator written by Daman and his team.\n</br/></br/></li></ul>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>For each test case, output a single line containing the maximum length of the matching sequence.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>T</b> \u2264 <b> 10 </b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b> K </b> \u2264 <b> N </b> \u2264 <b> 10^5 </b></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n2\n10 5\n6 4 2 1 9\n6 1 8 7 9\n10 4\n8 5 3 1\n7 6 4 2\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n3\n0\n</pre><h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p><b>Example case 1.</b> The sequence with maximum length that is common in both is {6,1,9}. </p>\n",
