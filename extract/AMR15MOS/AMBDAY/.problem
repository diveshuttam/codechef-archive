    "body": "<p>\nToday is <i>Chota Mouse's</i> birthday. He wants to celebrate it in a grand style. His brother <i>Mota Chuha</i> immediately contacted a nearby bakery for an online delivery of a cake. The cake is of rectangular shape with height <b>H</b> and width <b>W</b>. <i>Chota Mouse</i> has invited <b>F</b> of his friends to the party. So, he wants to make <b>F</b> vertical cuts at distinct positions on the cake, so that the cake will be divided into <b>F + 1</b> non-zero area parts (<b>F</b> for his friends and one for himself).\n</p>\n<p>\nLet us assume the cake is placed along the coordinate axis with its left end at <b>x</b> coordinate 0 and right end at <b>W</b>. Please see the image in the examples for details.<br />\nHe will make cuts at positions <b>P<sub>i</sub></b> such that <b>P<sub>i</sub></b> is strictly greater than zero and strictly less than <b>W</b>.<br />\nAlso note that, all the positions for cutting are distinct.\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>Chota Mouse</i> is a nice guy. So, he will be keeping the piece with the least area for himself and leave the other pieces for his friends to enjoy.<br />\n<i>Chota Mouse</i> is weak in mathematics, so can you please help him figure out the area of the piece he is going to have?\n</p>\n<h2>Input</h2>\n<p>The first line of the input contains an integer <b>T</b> denoting the number of test cases. The description of <b>T</b> test cases follows.</p>\n<p>First line of each test case contains three space separated integers <b>F, H, W</b>.</p>\n<p>Second line of each test case contains <b>F</b> space separated integers, i-th of them denotes <b>P<sub>i</sub></b>.</p>\n<h2>Output</h2>\n<p>For each test case, print a single integer corresponding to the answer of the problem.</p>\n<h2>Constraints</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>T</b> \u2264 <b>100</b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>F</b> \u2264 <b>500</b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>H</b> \u2264 <b>10000</b></li>\n<li><b>F + 1</b> \u2264 <b>W</b> \u2264 <b>10000</b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>P<sub>i</sub></b> \u2264 <b>W - 1</b></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Sample</h2>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<pre>\n3\n1 1 2\n1\n1 4 5\n3\n2 3 9\n6 2\n</pre><h3>Output</h3>\n<pre>\n1\n8\n6\n</pre><h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p><b>In the first example</b>,<br />\nboth the pieces have same area (i.e. = 1). <br />\n<img height=\"400\" src=\"http://icpc.amrita.ac.in/images_2015/Slide1.jpg\" />\n</p>\n<p><b>In the second example</b>,<br />\nthere are two pieces. First piece has an area of 12, second has an area of 8. So, the answer will be 8. <br />\n<img height=\"400\" src=\"http://icpc.amrita.ac.in/images_2015/Slide2.jpg\" />\n</p>\n<p><b>In the third example</b>,<br />\nthere are three pieces. First piece has an area of 6, second 12, and third 9. So, the answer will be 6.\n</p>\n",
