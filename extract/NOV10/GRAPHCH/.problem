Each vertex is a rectangle [ dimension of each vertex may be different ] . Your task is to place these vertices in 2-d space such that : </p>\n<ul>\n\t<li> No two vertices overlap [ remember, they are rectangles  ] </li>\n\t<li> All rectangles have their sides parallel to the axis. </li>\n\t<li> Rectangles cannot be rotated. </li>\n</ul>\n<br />\n<p> For every edge in the graph, add the manhattan distance between the centres of the vertex for each edge as the cost of a solution ( C ). <br />\nNow, there might be multiple ways to achieve this. So, you have to strive to keep C as low as possible. </p>\n\n<h3> Input </h3>\n\n<p> First line contains t ( \u2264 100 ) equal to the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line contains 2 space separated integers ( N and M respectively ). Then M lines follow, each line containing 2 integers x and y ( 0 \u2264 x,y &lt; N , x \u2260 y ) denoting an edge between vertex x and y. Then follow N lines, where line  number i contains 2 integers a and b denoting the dimension of the ith vertex [ Here, a denotes the length parallel to x-axis and b denotes the length parallel to y-axis ] </p>\n( <b> Note </b> : If the same pair x,y appears multiple times, it denotes multiple edges and hence, each pair contributes to the cost ). <br /><br />\n<b> NOTE : </b> Please note that all solutions will be tested on another set of test data <b> after the contest </b> which will follow the same pattern for test case generation ( as mentioned in 'Test Case Generation' section ).  <b>The final score for a solution will be the score of solution on latter test data. </b> <br />\n\n<h3> Output </h3>\n<p>\nFor each test case, print N lines , each containing 2 floating point numbers X and Y, denoting the co-ordinates of the centre of vertex i. <br /> \n<b> Note </b> : -10<sup>9</sup> \u2264 X,Y \u2264 10<sup>9</sup> . Solutions not following the mentioned constraints will be adjudged as wrong answer. <br />\n<b> Please note that the answers may not be optimal </b></p>\n\n<h3> Scoring </h3>\n\n<p> The Score for a solution  = (C+1). <br />\nYour total score is the sum of your score for all the test cases. <br />\nYou have to keep the score as low as possible. </p>\n\n<h3> Constraints </h3> \n<p>\n2 \u2264 N \u2264 50 <br />\n1 \u2264 M \u2264 200 [ The edges are randomly generated ] <br />\n1 \u2264 a,b \u2264 100000  <br />\nThere can be multiple edges between a pair of vertices.<br />\nAdditionally for 50% of the cases 2 \u2264 N \u2264 20. Also, for about 50% of cases, all vertices are squares [ a = b ] of same size. </p>\n\n<h3> Test Case Generation </h3> \n<p>\nThere are about 100 cases in total. For first 50 cases, the number of vertex ( n ) is chosen as a random number in the interval [3,20]. The number of edges (m) is chosen as a random number in the range [2, n*(n-1)/2]. Then all edges are chosen as random pair of integers. All vertex are given the same dimension with the probability 0.5 else they are given a random dimension in [1,100000] * [1,100000]. <br />\nFor other 50 cases, n is chosen as a random integer in the interval [3,50]. m is chosen randomly from [2, min( n*(n-1)/2, 200) ]. Rest of the procedure remains the same.  <br />\n\n</p>\n\n<h3> Sample Input </h3> <br />\n<pre>\n1\n2 1\n0 1\n2 2\n2 2\n</pre>\n\n<h3> Sample Output </h3> <br />\n<pre>\n2 2\n10 3\n</pre>\n<br />\n\n<b>Score for sample output</b> : 10.0  ( Better answers may be possible ) <br /><br />",
