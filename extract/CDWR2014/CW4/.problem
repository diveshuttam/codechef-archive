His idea is to use the first name of the coders and rank them according to his own ranking algorithm.</p>\n<p> Suppose the first name of some coder is \"duk\"(Venkatesh does not like capital letters). Venkatesh then wrote all permutations of the letters of \"duk\" in descending order.<br />\n<br /> ukd, udk, kud, kdu, duk, dku.<br />\n<br /> Now he numbers each permutation serially from 1. The serial number alloted to \"duk\" is his rank. Here \"duk\" gets a number \"5\" according to this algorithm.<br />\n<br /> However, the job is not done. Venkatesh needs to enter the details of this coder in an excel sheet in the column corresponding to this number. Columns in an excel<br />\n<br /> sheet are numbered alphabetically (in upper-case) as A,B,C,D.....Z,AA,AB......and so on. For example, the row corresponding to this number would be 'E'.<br />\n<br /> Assume that an excel sheet can have a large number of columns i.e column numbers like AAA,GHTY,KIUGH are possible.<br />\n<br /> Kindly help Venkatesh to find out which column to store his fellow coder's name in.\n</p>\n<h2>Input</h2>\n<p> The first line of the input contains an integer <b>T</b>(1&lt;=T&lt;=10) denoting the number of test cases. </p>\n<p> The next <b>T</b> lines will be a string of lower-case characters representing a coder's name, for which you need to find out the column id.</p>\n<p> Length of string will not exceed 10 characters.</p>\n<h2>Output</h2>\n<p> For each name, you need to print a string of upper-case alphabets corresponding to the column, where the name of the coder will be placed according to this algorithm.</p>\n\n<h2>Example</h2>\n<p> <b>Input:</b></p>\n<p>2<br />\n<br />duk<br />\n<br />abcde<br />\n<br />\n</p>\n<p> <b>Output:</b></p>\n<p>E<br />\n<br />DP<br />\n<br />\n</p>\n<h2>Explanation</h2>\n<p><b>Example case 1.</b> \"duk\" as shown above gets alloted a rank of 5. \"abcde\" will be the last element in the listing, so will be assigned a rank of 120; which when converted will fall into column DP.</p>\n",
