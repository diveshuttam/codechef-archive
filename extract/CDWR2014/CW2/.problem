As is the case with many programmers, one begins understanding algorithms with the help of<br />\n<br />pseudocode. Reeti has just started looking at some basic algorithms such as Bubble Sort, Binary Search etc. However, being a person with<br />\n<br />AOCD (Algorithmic Obsessive Compulsive Disorder), she does not rest until she has rigorously analysed the algorithm she is learning.\n</p>\n<p>\n<br />Now, she is looking at an algorithm to find the minimum element in an array. This is the pseudocode she is dealing with :<br />\n<br />1. \u00a0\u00a0int N;<br />\n<br />2. \u00a0\u00a0input N<br />\n<br />3. \u00a0\u00a0int arr[1:N];<br />\n<br />4. \u00a0\u00a0for i=1...N:<br />\n<br />5. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0input arr[i]<br />\n<br />6. \u00a0\u00a0int min = INFINITY;<br />\n<br />7. \u00a0\u00a0for i=1...N:<br />\n<br />8. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0if(arr[i]&lt;min)<br />\n<br />9. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0min = arr[i];\n</p>\n<p>\n<br />Reeti has just completed a course on Probability and Statistics, and being curious she decides to analyse the algorithm from a probabilistic<br />\n<br />point of view. She decides to ensure that the array arr is a randomly picked from the set of permutations of numbers 1,N.<br />\n<br />Her question is, what is the expected value of the number of reassignments to variable min i.e the number of times line 9 is executed.\n</p>\n\n<h2>Input</h2>\n<p> The first line of input is the number of test cases T.<br />\n<br /> The next T lines consist of a single integer N, i.e the size of the array for that test case.\n</p>\n<h2>Output</h2>\n<p> For each test case, print the expected value of the number of reassignments to min, with exactly 3 digits after the decimal point(rounded).<br />\n<br /> i.e Even if the answer is a whole number, print it as 5.000 </p>\n\n<h2>Example</h2>\n<p> <b>Input:</b></p>\n<p>\n<br />2<br />\n<br />1<br />\n<br />3<br />\n<br />\n</p>\n<p> <b>Output:</b></p>\n<p>1.000<br />\n<br />1.833<br />\n<br />\n</p>\n<h2>Explanation</h2>\n<p><b>Example case 1.</b> In the first test case, there is only 1 possible array. And we get one reassignment. So expected value is 1/1 = 1.<br />\n<br /> In the second test case, there are 6 possible arrays. In sorted order of arrays (descending), number of reassignments are 3,2,2,2,1,1. So expected value = 11/6 = 1.833 (3 decimal places)\n</p>\n",
