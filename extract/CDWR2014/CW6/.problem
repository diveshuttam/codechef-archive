He practices regularly as well, you can hear him playing even at 3 or 4 in the night.<br />\n<br />Unfortunately, he got into a fight in his room and his keyboard was damaged beyond repair. However, being a rich fellow he quickly ordered another one.<br />\n<br />But this time he felt a bit adventurous. He decided to buy a circular keyboard i.e keys are arranged in a circle.<br />\n<br />This funky keyboard has only 12 keys though - C,C#,D,D#,E,F,F#,G,G#,A,B and S.<br />\n<br />Since the layout is quite different to what he is used to, he needs to relearn basics of music theory again.<br />\n<br />Firstly, a semitone is the distance between any two keys. So there are 3 semitones between D and F, and 2 semitones between S and C# (remember it is circular!)<br />\n<br />He knows a chord is an unordered set of three or more than three keys. However, Ayan wants to start slow and considers only triads - chords of size 3.<br />\n<br />Triads come in two varieties - major and minor. In a major triad the number of semitones between the first and second key is 4, and between the second and third - 3.<br />\n<br />Minor triads on the other hand have 3 semitones between the first and second keys, 4 semitones between the second and third one.<br />\n<br />For example, D F# A is a major triad, while D F A is minor.<br />\n<br />Ayan needs your help classifying some basic triads. Kindly help him.<br />\n<br />\n</p>\n\n<h2>Input</h2>\n<p> The first line of input is the number of test cases T (1&lt;=T&lt;=25).<br />\n<br /> The next T lines contain three characters corresponding to the musical keys on the circular keyboard.<br />\n<br /> Note that # keys will be given as small letters and normal keys as capital letters. So C# will be given as c, while D will remain D.<br />\n<br /> It is guaranteed that the triads will be either major or minor.\n</p>\n<h2>Output</h2>\n<p> For each test case, print \"Major\" or \"Minor\" in a separate line, depending on whether the given triad is major or minor. </p>\n\n<h2>Example</h2>\n<p> <b>Input:</b></p>\n<p>\n<br />2<br />\n<br />E G S<br />\n<br />S d f<br />\n<br />\n</p>\n<p> <b>Output:</b></p>\n<p>Minor<br />\n<br />Major<br />\n<br />\n</p>\n<h2>Explanation</h2>\n<p><b>Example case 1.</b> E and G have a 3 semitone gap, while G and S have a 4 semitone gap. So Minor.<br />\n<br /> S and D# have a 4 semitone gap (remember circular) and D# and F# have a 3 semitone gap. So Major.\n</p>\n",
