On a fine day Chef Po was looking at his recipes book and after that he realised that it is almost impossible for him to search a recipe in that cluster containing a particular key ingredient. So he comes to you as a favour to develop a program that could find lexicographically smallest recipe present in L, a list of recipes, which is prefixed by the given key ingredient S. If no recipe is in L is prefixed by S then simply print S.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>First line of input contains a number T, number of test cases. First line of each test case contains a string S. Next line contains a number N which is the number of strings present in list L. Each of the next N line contains a string.</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>Print lexicographically smallest string present in L prefixed by S.</p>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<p>T&lt;=100<br /><br />\n\t\t|s| &lt;= 50<br /><br />\n\t\tN&lt;=10<br />\n</p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n1\ncheese\n3\ncheeseroll\nchees\ncheesetoast<br />\n<b>Output:</b>\ncheeseroll\n</pre><p>\u00a0</p>\n",
