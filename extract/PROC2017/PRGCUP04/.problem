All faucets receive water from the same external source. To lower the cost of the water system, not all faucets are connected directly to the water source, the piping may have tap-offs for \"intermediate\" faucets. Due to structural constraints, not all faucets and water source can be interconnected between them. A cost is associated with every plumbing possible between them.</p>\n<p>The student asked for help from computer programmer colleagues to provide a program that can calculate the minimum cost for all faucets to receive water from the source.</p>\n<p>As for plumbing it does not matter if a tip is the water source or a faucet, the tips will be called water points. The water points are numbered from 0 (source) to N (N taps). The inputs provide the costs to pass the pipes to connect 2 water points.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The first line of the input contains an integer <b>N</b> denoting the number faucets and an integer <b>C</b> denoting the number of plumbing connections between 2 water points.</p>\n<p>The next C lines contains <b>3</b> space-separated integers <b>2</b> integers represent water points and last integer is the cost associated this connection.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>Integer representing the minimum total cost to have water in all faucets of the building.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>N</b> \u2264 <b>100</b></li>\n<li><b>N</b> \u2264 <b>C</b> \u2264 <b>1000</b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>Connection cost</b> \u2264 <b>1000</b></li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Example 1</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n1 1\n0 1 2\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n2\n</pre>\n<h3>Example 2</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n4 8\n0 1 1\n0 2 8\n0 3 7\n0 4 6\n1 2 2\n1 4 5\n2 3 3\n3 4 8\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n11\n</pre>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p><b>Example 1.</b> Only connection possible with cost 2</p>\n<p><b>Example 2.</b> Connections resulting in minimum cost: (0,1), (1,2),(1,4), (2,3).</p>",
