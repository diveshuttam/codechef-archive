It's Chef's birthday month and so she has decided to organize a big sale in which grand discounts will be provided.</p>\n\n<p>In this sale, suppose a recipe should have a discount of <b>x</b> percent and its original price (before the sale) is <b>p</b>. Statistics says that when people see a discount offered over a product, they are more likely to buy it. Therefore, Chef decides to first increase the price of this recipe by <b>x</b>% (from <b>p</b>) and then offer a discount of <b>x</b>% to people.</p>\n\n<p>Chef has a total of <b>N</b> types of recipes. For each <b>i</b> (1 \u2264 <b>i</b> \u2264 <b>N</b>), the number of recipes of this type available for sale is <b>quantity<sub>i</sub></b>, the unit price (of one recipe of this type, before the <b>x</b>% increase) is <b>price<sub>i</sub></b> and the discount offered on each recipe of this type (the value of <b>x</b>) is <b>discount<sub>i</sub></b>.</p>\n\n<p>Please help Chef find the total loss incurred due to this sale, if all the recipes are sold out.</p> \n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The first line of the input contains a single integer <b>T</b> denoting the number of test cases. The description of <b>T</b> test cases follows.</li>\n<li>The first line of each test case contains a single integer <b>N</b> denoting the number of recipe types.</li>\n<li><b>N</b> lines follow. The <b>i</b>-th of these lines contains three space-separated integers <b>price<sub>i</sub></b>, <b>quantity<sub>i</sub></b> and <b>discount<sub>i</sub></b> describing the <b>i</b>-th recipe type.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>For each test case, print a single line containing one real number \u2014 the total amount of money lost. Your answer will be considered correct if it has an absolute error less than 10<sup>-2</sup>.</p>\n\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>1 \u2264 <b>T</b> \u2264 10</li>\n<li>1 \u2264 <b>N</b> \u2264 10<sup>5</sup></li>\n<li>1 \u2264 <b>price<sub>i</sub></b>, <b>quantity<sub>i</sub></b> \u2264 100 for each valid <b>i</b></li>\n<li>0 \u2264 <b>discount<sub>i</sub></b> \u2264 100 for each valid <b>i</b></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Subtasks</h3>\n\n<p><b>Subtask #1 (30 points):</b> 1 \u2264 <b>N</b> \u2264 100</p>\n\n<p><b>Subtask #2 (70 points):</b> original constraints</p>\n\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n\n2\n2\n100 5 10\n100 1 50\n3\n10 10 0\n79 79 79\n100 1 100\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n\n30.000000000\n3995.0081000\n</pre>\n\n<h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p><b>Example case 1:</b> There are two recipes.</p>\n<p>There are 5 recipes of the first type, each of them has a price of 100 and there is a 10% discount provided on it. Therefore, Chef first increases the price of each recipe by 10%, from 100 to 110. After that, she decreases the price by 10%, which makes the final price 99. The amount of money lost for each unit is 1, thus losing 5 for recipes of the first type.</p>\n\n<p>There is only one recipe of the second type, with price 100 and a 50% discount. Therefore, Chef increases the price of the recipe by 50% from 100 to 150 and after that, she decreases its price by 50% to make its final price 75. She loses 25 for this recipe.</p>\n\n<p>Overall, the amount of money Chef loses is 30.</p>\n",
