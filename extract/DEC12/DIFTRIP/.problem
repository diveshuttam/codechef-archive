What makes the Chef impressed the most is the road system of the country. Byteland has <b>N</b> cities numbered 1 through <b>N</b>. City 1 is the capital of Byteland. The country also has <b>N</b>-1 bidirectional roads connecting the cities. The <b>i</b>-th road connects two different cities <b>u<sub>i</sub></b> and <b>v<sub>i</sub></b>. In this road system, people can travel between every pair of different cities by going through exactly one path of roads.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe roads are arranged in such a way that people can distinguish two cities only when both cities have different number of roads connected to it. Such two cities will be considered <i>similar</i>. For example, city <b>A</b> is similar to the capital if the number of roads connected to city <b>A</b> is equal to the number of roads connected to the capital.\n</p>\n<p>\nOn each day during the vacation, the Chef wants to have a trip as follows. He chooses two cities <b>A</b> and <b>B</b> such that the Chef will visit city <b>B</b> if he goes from <b>A</b> to the capital using the shortest path. Then, the Chef will visit the cities on the shortest path from <b>A</b> to <b>B</b> through this path. Please note that <b>A</b> may be equal to <b>B</b>; that means the Chef will enjoy the day in a single city.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe Chef does not want to have <i>similar</i> trips. Two trips are considered <i>similar</i> if and only if<br />\nthey both have the same number of visited cities and for each <b>i</b>, the <b>i</b>-th city visited in one trip is <i>similar</i> to the <b>i</b>-th city visited in the other trip.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe Chef wants to have as many different, namely not <i>similar</i>, trips as possible. Help him count the maximum number of possible trips such that no two of them are similar.</p>\n<p><h3>Input</h3>\n</p><p>\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer <b>N</b>. The <b>i</b>-th line of next <b>N</b>-1 lines contains two space-separated integers <b>u<sub>i</sub></b> and <b>v<sub>i</sub></b>, denoting the <b>i</b>-th road.\n</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>\nOutput a single line containing the maximum number of different trips.\n</p>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<p>\n1 \u2264 <b>N</b> \u2264 100000 (10<sup>5</sup>)<br /><b>u<sub>i</sub></b> \u2260 <b>v<sub>i</sub></b><br /><br />\nEvery pair of different cities can be traveled by going through exactly one path of roads.</p>\n<h3>Sample</h3>\n<pre>\n<b>Input</b>:\n3\n2 1\n3 1\n\n<b>Output</b>:\n3\n</pre><h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p>\nIn the sample, the country consists of three cities.<br />\nThere are two roads. The first road connects city 1 and city 2.<br />\nThe second road connects city 1 and city 3.<br />\nEach day, the Chef can choose the following possible trips:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<b>A</b> = 1, <b>B</b> = 1\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>A</b> = 2, <b>B</b> = 2\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>A</b> = 3, <b>B</b> = 3\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>A</b> = 2, <b>B</b> = 1\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>A</b> = 3, <b>B</b> = 1\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\nHowever, since the trip (<b>A</b> = 2, <b>B</b> = 2) is similar to the trip (<b>A</b> = 3, <b>B</b> = 3),<br />\nand the trip (<b>A</b> = 2, <b>B</b> = 1) is similar to the trip (<b>A</b> = 3, <b>B</b> = 1),<br />\nthere are only three possible different trips for the Chef.\n</p>\n",
