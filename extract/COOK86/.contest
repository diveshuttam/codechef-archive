At CodeChef, we work hard to revive the geek in you by hosting a programming contest at the start of the month and another smaller programming challenge in the middle of the month.</p>\r\n<h4>About CodeChef September Cook-Off:</h4>\r\n<p class=\"last\">CodeChef September Mega Cook-Off is a two and half hour coding contest where you can show off your computer programming skills. <br /><br /><b>Top 50 Indian students will be eligible for ACM ICPC travel reimbursement. Each of them shall be reimbursed an amount of upto INR 1500 upon producing the travel bills.

Also we believe that it is alright to refer to tutorials, books and other materials, learn a concept and then apply the same to solve a problem during a contest. But it is <b>not alright to copy other people's solutions or seek other people's help to solve a problem without understanding it.</b> The dividing line may seem to be thin but it can be captured by the spirit of learning. If whatever you are doing is making you learn while you do so, we tend to believe that it is alright. However, all the participants are expected to abide to <a class=\"button blue\" href=\"http://discuss.codechef.com/questions/18662/does-codechef-have-any-code-of-conduct\">CodeChef Code Of Conduct</a></p>\r\n<p>Not just that, as a token of motivation we also give away goodies to the winners of the contest.</p>\r\n<p><b>For Indians:</b></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Top 10 from ranklist will get CodeChef laddus</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><b>For Rest of World:</b></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Top 10 from ranklist will get CodeChef laddus</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p class=\"last\">With CodeChef laddus, the winners can claim cool CodeChef goodies. Know more here: <a href=\"/laddu\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.codechef.com/laddu</a>.
