Bob, on the other hand, was unable to \ufb01nd these with his experiments. With an eagerness to \ufb01nd those symbols he reached out to Alice's Servant for dirty tricks. Smart Servant doesn't want his Lady's magic symbols to be directly handed to empty-headed people. Therefore The Servant challenges Bob's intelligence and gives a sample to work out. Once Bob Solves, the Magic Symbols will be revealed. The servant gives two numbers a and b and a base number X. Bob needs to \ufb01nd a total number of symbols that is needed to convert all numbers from a to b (including a & b) into base X.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The \ufb01rst line contains a integer t ,denoting number of test cases. The next t lines contains 3 integers separate with space: a b X. </p>\n\n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>For each test case, output the total number of symbols that needs to convert all numbers from a to b (including a & b) into base X in separate line. </p>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b>0</b> \u2264 <b>a</b> \u2264 <b>b<b> \u2264 <b>10^15</b></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><b>2</b> \u2264 <b>X</b> \u2264 <b>10^3</b></li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n3 \n1 5 3\n3 10 4\n4 12 3\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n8 \n15\n22 \n</pre>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p><b>Case I : In base 3, 1 can be written as 1, 2 can be written as 2, 3 can be written as 11, 4 can be written as 12, 5 can be written as 22. So, Total number of symbols used is 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 8</b> </p>",
