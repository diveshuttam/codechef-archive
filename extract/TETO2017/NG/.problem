He is walking with a constant speed because of his old age. They are walking in a route which is a polygonal line (possibly self intersecting). The end points are specified by the N pairs of integers (Xi,Yi) - their cartesian coordinates. Amy is very naughty and always go here and there, but he always meet up his grandpaa at the specified N points. Amy starts his journey simultaneously with Pankaj at the point (X1, Y1) and also finishes it simultaneously with his grandfather at the point (Xn,Yn). Amy can walk at a speed that is up to two times greater than his grandpaa's speed. While Pankaj travels in a straight line from one point to another, the cheerful grandson seeks gardens, icecream corners and all other kinds of interesting places of the city which are specified by M pairs of integers (X\u2032 j,Y\u2032 j). However, after leaving his grandpaa at the point (Xi,Yi) (where 1 \u2264 i < N) amy visits at most one interesting place before meeting his grandpaa again at the point (Xi+1,Yi+1). Your task is to find the grandson's route, which meets all the above requirements and allows him to visit the maximal possible number of interesting places. The answer should be presented as sorted coordinates by x-axis that represents amy's route. The vertices of this route should be all points(Xi,Yi) and the maximal number of interesting places(X\u2032 j,Y\u2032 jX). The latter should be visited(i.e. listed in the route description) at most once. An example of Grandfather\u2019s route (solid line), a set of interesting places (dots) and one of the best amy\u2019s routes (dotted line) are presented in the following picture:\n\n<img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/codechef_shared/download/TETO2017/1.png\"></img>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The first line of the input is an integer L, then followed by L datasets. The first line of each dataset contains two integers N and M, separated by a space (2 \u2264 N \u2264 100, 0 \u2264 M \u2264 100). The second line contains N pairs of integers X1,Y1,...,XN,YN, separated by spaces, that represent Pankaj's route. The third line contains M pairs of integers X\u2032 1,Y\u2032 1,...,X\u2032M,Y\u2032 M, separated by spaces, that represent interesting places. These integers are not greater than 1000.\n</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n\n<p>\nThe first line for each dataset should contain the single integer K \u2014 the number of vertices of the best amy\u2019s route. The second line should contain K pairs of coordinates X\u2032\u2032 1,Y\u2032\u2032 1 ,...,X\u2032\u2032 K,Y\u2032\u2032 K, separated by spaces, that represent this route sorted by x-axis coordinates (if x-axis coordinate values are same, it will be further sorted by y-axis value e.g. {{1, 3}, {1, 2}} should result {{1, 2}, {1, 3}}).\n<br>Note : A co-ordinate can be part of solution but it can be only added once to the solution,i.e.<br>\nif a node(X,Y) is visited once, it can't be revisited.\n</p>\n\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b>2</b> \u2264 <b>N</b> \u2264 <b>100</b></li>\n<li><b>0</b> \u2264 <b>M</b> \u2264 <b>100</b></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre>\n<b>Input:</b>\n1\n4 5 \n1 4 5 7 5 2 -2 4\n -4 -2 3 9 1 2 -1 3 8 -3\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n6\n-2 4 1 2 1 4 3 9 5 2 5 7\n</pre>\n<p>\u00a0</p>",
