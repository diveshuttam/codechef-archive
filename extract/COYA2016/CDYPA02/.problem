It is followed by T test cases. Each test case has 3 lines. First line is the number of boxes N and the next line has N space separated integers where the ith integer is the number of chalks in the ith box and 3rd line of each test case contains value of K.</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>For each test case, output a single number, the number of ways in which he can select the boxes.</p>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>T</b> \u2264 <b>100</b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>N</b> &lt; <b>10^5</b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>Number of chalks in ith     box</b>\u2264<b>1000</b>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n2\n5\n1 2 3 4 3\n6\n5\n10 20 10 5 50 \n100\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n2\n2\n</pre>",
