You should also find the resulting right password. If there are several such numbers, then print the lexicographically minimum one.\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>Input description.</p>\n<p>The first line contains two space-separated integers n and k  which represent how many digits the number has and how many equal digits a right password should have. The second line consists of n digits. It describes the  number which Raju took for calculating the password . It is guaranteed that the number contains no spaces and only contains digits.</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>On the first line print the minimum sum of money Raju needs to change the number. On the second line print the right password. If there are several solutions, print the lexicographically minimum one.</p>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b>2</b> \u2264 <b>N</b> \u2264 <b>10<sup>4</sup></b></li>\n<li><b>2</b> \u2264 <b>K</b> \u2264 <b>10<sup>4</sup></b></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n5 3\n12345\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n2\n12444\n</pre>",
