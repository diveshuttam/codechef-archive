The college where they study is a very big and beautiful building having address = 1.

Note that the college is also included in these houses.</p>\n<p>\u00a0Raju and Gopi have decided to play Hide and Seek taking the entire town as their arena. In the given scenario of the game, it's Raju's turn to hide and Gopi is supposed to find him.<br />\nRaju can hide in any of the houses in the town including the college.

If Gopi reaches house X, then he surely finds Raju.</p>\n<p>Given Q queries, you need to tell Gopi if it is possible for him to find Raju or not.</p>\n<p> The queries can be of the following two types:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n0 X Y : Gopi moves towards the college.\n</li><li>\n1 X Y : Gopi moves away from the college.\n</li></ul>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The first line of the input contains a single integer <b>N</b>, total number of houses in the town. Next N-1 lines contain two space separated integers <b>A</b> and <b>B</b> denoting a road between the houses at address A and B.</li>\n<li>\nNext line contains a single integer <b>Q</b> denoting the number of queries.</li>\n<li>\nFollowing Q lines contain three space separated integers representing each query as explained above.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>Print \"YES\" or \"NO\" for each query depending on the answer to that query..</p>\n<h3>Constraints:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>N</b> \u2264 <b>10<sup>6</sup></b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>A,B</b> \u2264 <b>N</b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>Q</b> \u2264 <b>10<sup>5</sup></b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>X,Y</b> \u2264 <b>N</b></li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Example:</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n8\n1 2\n1 4\n1 6\n2 3\n4 5\n6 8\n6 7\n4\n0 4 5\n1 4 5\n0 7 4\n1 8 1\n\n<b>Output:</b>\nYES\nNO\nNO\nYES\n\n</pre><p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p>Query 1 Gopi goes from 5 towards 1(college) meeting 4 in the path.
