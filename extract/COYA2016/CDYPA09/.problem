The only way he can gain access to these safes is by knowing their passwords.He know that if he would select the first option then he will definitely fail in tomorrow,s exam.So There is nothing he can do other than waiting for his mother.</p>\n<p>\u00a0Suddenly Raju remembered what his mother taught him about these safes. he remembered that the password to each safe is in the form of a square matrix containing digits from 0 to 9. Each row of the matrix has a prime number. Also, the password matrix is symmetric in nature i.e. Transpose( A)=A.</p>\n<p>Now the problem is that Raju only remembers the prime numbers n<sub>i</sub> in the first line of each safe\u2019s password but he knows that total digits of n<sub>i</sub> determines the dimension of password matrix for safe i.</p>\n<p>Can you help him in finding the total password combinations for each safe???</p>\n<p>Each prime number can occur in one than one rows of password matrix or in several matrices. The prime numbers which are not first line prime numbers can start with zeros.</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The first line of the input contains an integer t  \u2014 the number of safes. Next t lines contain integers n<sub></sub>, n<sub>i</sub>is a prime number written in the first row of the password matrix for the i-th safe. All n<sub>i</sub>'sdo not have leading zeros.</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>Print t numbers, the i-th of them should be the number of matrices that can be a password to the i-th safe. Print the numbers on separate lines.</p>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>t</b> \u2264 <b>30</b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>n<sub>i</sub></b> \u2264 <b>99999</b></li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n4\n11\n239\n401\n9001\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n4\n28\n61\n2834</pre>",
