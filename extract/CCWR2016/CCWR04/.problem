He found that the students can\u2019t solve problems based on trees and graphs and so to improve their skills he has come up with a series of problems. The easiest of them is being given to you to solve. \n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nThe problem is as follows:\nYou are given a 1-indexed tree consisting of N nodes. Each node has a colour associated with it. Your job is to find the subtree of this tree such that it is a Mono tree and consists of max number of nodes. A tree is said to be a Mono tree if all its nodes are of the same colour.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\nFind out the number of the nodes in the maximum Mono subtree of the given tree.\n</p>\n\n\n<h3>Input:</h3>\n<p>\n\nFirst line contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.<br>\nFirst line of every test case contains an integer N denoting the number of nodes in the tree.<br>\nThe second line of every test case contains N space separated integers denoting the colour associated with the i<sup>th</sup> node.<br> \nThe following N-1 lines contain 2 space separated integers denoting the N-1 edges of the tree. E.g. x y implies there exists an edge from node indexed x to node indexed y and that x is the parent of y.\n<br>\n</p>\n\n<h3>Output:</h3>\n\n<p>\nFor every test case, print the number of nodes in the maximum Mono subtree of the given tree in a single line.\n\n</p>\n\n<h3>Constraints:</h3>\n\n<p>1 \u2264 T \u2264 500</p>\n<p>1 \u2264 N\u00a0\u2264 100</p>\n\n<h3>Example:</h3>\n\n<h4>Input:</h4>\n\n<p>1</p>\n<p>6</p>\n<p>1 1 1 1 2 2</p>\n<p>1 2</p>\n<p>2 3</p>\n<p>2 4</p>\n<p>1 5</p>\n<p>1 6</p>\n\n<h4>Output:</h4>\n\n<p>3</p>\n\n<h3>Explanation: </h3>\n<p>The given tree is as shown in the figure below : <br>\n\n <img src=\"https://s3.postimg.io/ggdpro0tf/monotree.jpg\"  height=\"242\" width=\"242\">   \n\n<br>\n\n\n\n</body>\n\n</html>\n\n",
