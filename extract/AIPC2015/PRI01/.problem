Birju decided to call the students roll number-wise.<br />Now Anshul is the first roll number in the class and Jay is the 2nd <br />Birju invited Anshul on stage to ask the question. Anshul asked the class to find the nth Fibonacci number, <br />but Jay also had same question in his mind. <br />So when birju called Jay to share his question, in a dilemma he quickly asked the class to find the nth non-fibonacci number.\n</p>\n<p>But problem arised was Jay doesn't know how to find <b>nth non-fibonacci number</b>, <br /><u>so he has asked for your help to find nth non-fibonacci number.</u> Write the program to help Tanna..</p>\n<h3>Input:</h3>\n<pre>\nFirst line contains number t, total number of test cases.<br />Then next t lines contain one number n for which you have to find nth non-fibonacci number.\n</pre><h3>output:</h3>\n<pre>\nt lines containing nth non-fibonacci number for each test cases.\n</pre><h3>constraints:</h3>\n<pre>\n0 &lt; t &lt;= 1000000\n0 &lt; n &lt;= 100000000\n</pre><h3>sample test case:</h3>\n<pre>\n5\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n</pre><h3>sample output:</h3>\n<pre>\n4\n6\n7\n9\n10\n</pre>",
