Due to which many of the contestants kept getting WA although when their submissions were correct. So, we have rejudged the <b>Non-Accepted </b> solutions according to the equation as mentioned in the problem statement to keep the contest fair for everyone. According to our new ranklist, Top 3 winners are:\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>stolis</li>\r\n<li>vivekmufc</li>\r\n<li>triveni</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nWe are really sorry for the inconvenience that you all faced.",
