Yes it was Kirmada back again to conquer Dholakpur, the only kingdom left in the world that was not conquered by him. He challenged Bheem again to save Dholakpur as this time Kirmada was even stronger than earlier, but this time the challenge was not to fight against him to save Dholakpur but the challenge was with numbers.<br />\nWith his magical power Kirmada concatenated all the number from <b> 1 </b> to <b>N</b> and gave Bheem a number <b> k </b> and challenged him to tell the digit at <b>k<sup>th</sup></b> index in the concatenated number. Help Bheem win this challenge and save Dholakpur.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The first line of the input contains an integer <b>T</b> denoting the number of test cases.
