So she decided to talk to sonu as he being mutual of both.<br>\nOn having conversation he just gave him a key value 'A' saying its a encrypted value which will be decrypted only If you put your value ' C'  with titu value 'B' in the function with each character of message which could be a repetitive process for getting complete message.<br>\nTo make that message clear to her she invited titu for a date where she...<br>Somehow managed to convenience titu to give her the key value 'B' along with the encrypted letters.<br>\nHelp Sweety to decrypt and encrypt messages  <br>\n<br>\nInput Format<br><br>\nFirst line of input contains t i.e no of test cases<br>\nSecond line contains \"case\" either 1 (for encription )\nor 0 (for Description)<br>\nThird line of input contains values of  A,B,C and if case is 0 then it also contains N (i.e no  of encrypted numbers)<br>\nForth line contains message for case 1 and encrypted numbers for case 0<br><br>\nOutput Format <br><br>\nPrint Encrypted/Decrypted message depending on case<br><br>\n\nSample input<br><br>\n\n2<br>\n1<br>\n23 15 62<br>\nAvenir<br>\n0<br>\n11 35 15 10<br>\n3556 4479 5256 5447 4656 4977 3972 5297 3150 3091<br>\n<br><br>\nSample Output<br>\n<br>\n2533 4544 3903 4246 4049 4396<br>\nMarvelVsDC<br>\n<br>\nExplanation Test Case 1:<br><br> Putting each character of message in function f(x)=Ax+By+C and getting 1st level of encryption .<br><br>\nDoing XOR with each f(x) to get next level of encryption <br><br>\n23 * ( 'A') + 15 * ( 'A' ) + 62 = 2532<br>\n2532 XOR 1 = 2533<br><br>\n23 * ( 'v') + 15 * ( 'v' ) + 62 = 4546<br>\n4546 XOR 2 = 4544<br>\n23 * ( 'e') + 15 * ( 'e' ) + 62 = 3900<br>\n3900 XOR 3 = 3903 ... <br><br>\n\nExplanation Test Case 2:<br><br> Performing XOR with each number of encrypted message <br>\nPutting each character of message in function f(x)=Ax+By+C and getting decrypted msg<br><br>\n\n3556  XOR 1 = 3557<br>\n11 * x + 35 * x + 15 = 3557<br>\n x =  'M'<br>\n<br>\n4479  XOR 2 = 4477<br>\n11 * x + 35 * x + 15 = 4477<br>\n x =  'a'<br>\n<br>\n5256  XOR 3 = 5259<br>\n11 * x + 35 * x + 15 = 5259<br>\n x =  'r'<br>\n",
