Everybody has come to watch this spectacular event. The Event is going to start with a Marchpast. Since, the event has already been delayed by an hour, the students participating in the Marchpast line up randomly to save time.<br />\n<br />\nNow, the instructor got confused on how to arrange them properly in a short period of time. Therefore, he comes up with an idea that: He will remove the minimum number of students from the line such that he will end up with a line that has the students standing in <b>monotonically</b> increasing order according to their height.<br />\n<br />\nTo solve this tedious task he asks you to come up with an optimal solution. Since there is no time for excuses.\n</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>\nFirst line contains single integer N, number of students.<br />\nNext N lines, contain single integer denoting the height of the <b>i<sup>th</sup></b> student.\n</p>\n<h3>Ouput</h3>\n<p>\nSingle Integer Output as explained in the Problem Statement.\n</p>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<p><strong>\n<ul>\n<li>1 \u2264 N \u2264 1,000,000</li>\n<li>0 \u2264 A[i] \u2264 1,000,000,000</li>\n</ul>\n<p></p></strong></p>\n<h3>Sample Input:</h3>\n<p>\n6<br />\n1<br />\n0<br />\n3<br />\n5<br />\n2<br />\n7\n</p>\n<h3>Sample Output:</h3>\n<p>\n2\n</p>\n<h3>Explanation:</h3>\n<p>\n{1, 0, 3, 5, 2, 7} if we remove {0, 2} we will get the desired output i.e. {1, 3, 5, 7} in which the students are in monotonically increasing order.\n</p>\n",
