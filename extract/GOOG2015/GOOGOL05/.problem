So, to make the inspection procedure really fast and smooth he made a list of all the laboratories of the department.</p>\n<p>He had asked some of his juniors to compile this list department wise. But the juniors were really lazy (matiyao types) and thus they inturn distributed the work. Now in the end the final list that Varun Sir has is a lot of strings which consists of department names. Each string represents one laboratory. Refer to example for the output.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The first line of input contains the number of strings n <br />\nthe next n lines each contains a string of length 100 max and consists of only lower case alphabets. <br />\n1 &lt;= n &lt;= 500  </p>\n<p>7 <br />\ncse <br />\nmnc <br />\ncse <br />\nele <br />\ncse <br />\nzzza <br />\nphysics </p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p><br />\ncse 3 <br />\nele 1 <br />\nmnc 1 <br />\nphysics 1 <br />\nzzza 1 </p>\n<h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p>The output contains strings sorted lexicographically and the number in front of them indicates the number of times they occured in the input.</p>\n",
