As all of his clanmates have used both of their attacks and he is left with his last attack. In order to win the clan war he must make a perfect attack gaining three stars. He is a very typical clasher, for this he has come up with a special strategy. He has <b>N</b> types of troop. Each troop has different heights, <b>H<sub>i</sub></b>. All soldiers belonging to the same troop have same height. He likes to arrange his army in a straight line such that the height of soldiers should be in non-increasing or non-decreasing order maintaining the following constraints:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>His army must contain <b>N</b> soldiers.</li>\n<li>His army can contain any number of soldiers from one troop.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>He wants to know the number of ways in which he can arrange his army. As this number can be very large, print it modulo <b>10^9+7</b>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The first line of the input contains an integer <b>T</b> denoting the number of test cases. The description of <b>T</b> test cases follows.</li>\n<p><br /></p>\n<li>Each line contains a single integer <b>N</b>, the size of his army.</li>\n<p><br />\n</p></ul>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>Print <b>T</b> lines each containing a single integer, the answer to each test case.</p>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>T</b> \u2264 <b>10^6</b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>N</b> \u2264 <b>10^5</b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>H<sub>i</sub></b> \u2264 <b>N</b></li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n<p>2\n3\n1</p>\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n<p>17\n1</p>\n</pre>",
