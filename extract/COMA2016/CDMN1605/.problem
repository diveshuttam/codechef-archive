There were a total of <b>N</b> cities which was represented by a single representative clan. To determine the strongest clan a tournament was organized in which every representative clan had to attack every other clan. <br /><br />\nIn order to attack, the attacking clan  visited the other cities, but the roads were very few, exactly <b>N-1</b>. Also they could reach any city from any other city going on those roads.<br /><br />\nThese clans were great believer of the power of P.E.K.K.A . So for the good luck in war they build a statue of P.E.K.K.A on the road they got maximum elixir. If there were several such roads, then one statue was built on each of them.<br />\nRecently, when the records of the war were found, it became clear that each city attacked each other one exactly once.<br /><br />\nThere were exactly <b>n(n-1)</b> attacks in total.<br /><br />\nNow, everyone is wondering which is the most powerful road. The most powerful road is the one with maximum number of statues of P.E.K.K.A .\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The first line of the input contains an integer <b>T</b> denoting the number of test cases.
