    "body": "<span class=\"solution-visible-txt\">All submissions for this problem are available.</span><p>The leaf village is destroyed and as a responsible hokage, Naruto has decided to rebuild the village with sturdier security measures. To ensure better security, Naruto wants to set up 4 identical check posts such that the check-posts form the vertices of a <b>square</b>. The leaf village is in form of an <b>(n+1)*(n+1)</b> grid and and check-posts can be set up at the intersection point of any two lines. Only one-check post can be set up at one point. Naruto also wants to ensure faster communication between check-posts. Since communication lines have been laid along the grid directions (i.e. x and y directions), either the <b>side</b> of the square or it\u2019s <b>diagonal</b> must be along these directions(x and y).\n\n\nNaruto wants to determine all possible ways of establishing check-posts. Having skipped Math 101 to practice his Shadow clone jutsu, he needs your help. Help Naruto determine the no of possible ways in which he can set check-posts.\n</p>\n\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The first line has <b>t</b> denoting the number of test cases. <br><br>\nThe next t lines contain the value of <b>n</b>.\n</p>\n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>Output a single number denoting the no of possible ways of setting check-posts. Since this answer can be very large print the answer mod <b>10^9+7</b>.\n</p>\n\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>t</b> \u2264 <b> 1000000</b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>n</b> \u2264 <b> 1000000000</b> </li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<p>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n2\n1\n2\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n1\n6\n</pre>\n</p>\n\n<h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p><b>Example case 2.</b>\n<img src=\"https://codechef_shared.s3.amazonaws.com/download/upload/COM2018/COM2018.png\" />\nAs shown in the image following 6 squares are possible {ABED,BCFE,DEHG,EFIH,ACIG,DBFH}. <br>\nAll these squares have vertices on the points of the grid.\nDBFH has it\u2019s diagonals along the grid directions, whereas the remaining squares have their sides along the grid directions.\n</p>",
