    "body": "<span class=\"solution-visible-txt\">All submissions for this problem are available.</span><p>A Cyber War has started between the IT companies in the city of <b>Hashland</b>. Companies are forming a team to defeat their rivals. Each teams consists of some <b>Script Kiddies</b> and zero or more <b>Black Hat Hackers</b>. Every member of the team has some importance in increasing the strength of their team. <b>Script Kiddies</b> are aligned in a row one after the other followed by <b>Black Hat Hackers</b>. Each <b>Script Kiddie</b> has a number assigned to him from <b>0</b> to <b>9</b>, both inclusive. Every <b>Black Hat Hacker</b> is assigned a special value of <b>!</b> denoting the factorial operation. The total stength of a team is its total numerical value after applying the factorial operation (if any). Your Job is to find out who will win in a 1-vs-1 war between two given companies.\n</p>\n\n<pre>\nNote: Factorial operation is shown below\n 5! = 5*4*3*2*1 \n 4! = 4*3*2*1\n</pre>\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>First line of Input contains a single integer <b>T</b> denoting the number of test cases. Each test case contains two lines denoting the teams.\n</p>\n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>For each test case print one value denoting the winner. Print <b>-1</b> if the first team loses. Print <b>0</b> in case of tie. Print <b>1</b> if first team wins. Print your answers for each test case in a new line.\n</p>\n\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>T</b> \u2264 <b>200</b></li>\n<li>Each team can consists between 1 and 50 (both inclusive) persons in total. The integer value of the <b>Script Kiddies</b> for a team satisfy the following constraints -\n<ol>\n<li> The value is a non-negative integer less than 10^9. </li>\n<li> There are no leading zeros. </li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ul>\nFor e.g. in <b>145!!</b> the integer value is 145.\n\n\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n3\n12!\n13!\n12!!\n13!\n4!\n24\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n-1\n1\n0\n\n</pre>\n\n<h3>Explanation</h3>\n<ul><li> For the first case 12!<13!, so the answer is -1.</li>\n <li>For the second case, 12!! is 479001600! which is greater than 13!, so the answer is 1.</li>\n <li>For the third case, 4! is 24. So the total strength of both teams are same. Hence, the answer is 0 for this case.</li></ul>",
