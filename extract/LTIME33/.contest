The dividing line may seem to be thin but it can be captured by the spirit of learning. If whatever you are doing is making you learn while you do so, we tend to believe that it is alright.</p> <br /> <p>Not just that, as a token of motivation we also give away cash prizes and goodies to the winners of the contest. However, our sole intention lies in making our users learn new concepts while competing. FYI, here are the list of prizes: <br /><br /> <b class=\"rules-heading\">For Indians:</b></p> <ul class=\"\"> <li>Top 10 school students from ranklist get a goodie &amp; a certificate</li> </ul> <b class=\"rules-heading\">For Rest of World:</b> <ul class=\"\"> <li>Top 10 school students from ranklist get a goodie &amp; a certificate</li> </ul> </div> <p><br /> <b class=\"rules-heading\">What's new in CodeChef?</b></p> <div class=\"rules-body\"> <p>You may now play with our new\u00a0<a href=\"http://blog.codechef.com/2015/02/04/play-more-in-discuss-with-groups-latex/\">groups &amp; LaTex feature</a> on discuss.</p> </div> <p><br /> <b class=\"rules-heading\">Rules and Regulations:</b></p> <ul class=\"\"> <div>This is an IOI style contest.
