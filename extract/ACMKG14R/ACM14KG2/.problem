    "body": "<p>Ram has <b>N</b> different crackers. These crackers are very special, each of them can fire infinite number of fire-balls. Ram made an arrangement with those <b>N</b> crackers. If the spark is currently with the <b>i</b>'th cracker, it will first fire a fire-ball, and then it will pass the spark to the <b>(i+1)</b>'th cracker. Note that the <b>N</b>'th cracker will pass spark to the <b>1</b>'st cracker. Ram initially placed the spark at the <b>a</b>'th cracker. However the spark will get exhausted after <b>M</b> passes, that is, it gets off during <b>M+1</b>'th pass. Ram want to know which cracker will fire the last fire-ball before spark goes off. Write a program to print this answer.</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The first line of the input contains an integer <b>T</b> denoting the number of test cases.<br />\nFollowing <b>T</b> lines describe the test cases, one per line.<br />\nEach line contains 3 integers, <b>N</b>, <b>a</b> and <b>M</b>.</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>For each test case output one line, which contains the required answer.</p>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>T</b> \u2264 <b>1000</b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>N</b> \u2264 <b>1000</b></li>\n<li><b>0</b> \u2264 <b>M</b> \u2264 <b>1000</b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>a</b> \u2264 <b>N</b></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n3\n5 1 3\n5 1 5\n5 1 19\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n4\n1\n5\n</pre><h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p><b>Test case #1:</b><br />\nSpark is initially at the 1'st cracker. It fires a fire-ball and passes spark to the 2'nd cracker. The 2'nd cracker fires a fire-ball and passes the spark to the 3'rd cracker. The 3rd cracker fires a fire-ball and passes spark to the 4th cracker. The 4th cracker fires a fire-ball and passes the spark to the 5'th cracker, however, we already made 3 passes and this is 4th pass, so spark gets off. The last cracker to fire a fire-ball is the 4'th cracker.\n</p>\n<p><b>Test case #2:</b><br />\nSpark is initially at the 1'st cracker. It fires a fire-ball and passes spark to the 2'nd cracker. After the 4'th pass, the spark is with the 5'th cracker. The 5'th cracker fires a fire-ball and passes it to the 1'st cracker (Read the statement carefully, the N'th cracker passes spark to the 1'st cracker). The 1'st cracker fires the fire-ball and passes to the 2'nd cracker, spark gets exhausted during this pass. So the last cracker to fire was the 1'st.\n</p>\n",
