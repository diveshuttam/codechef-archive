Ties will be broken by the total time for each team in ascending order of time.</li> <li>Compilation error will not count towards the penalty.</li> <li>The total time is the sum of the time consumed for each problem solved. The time consumed for a solved problem is the time elapsed from the beginning of the contest to the submittal of the first accepted run plus 20 penalty minutes for every previously rejected run for that problem. There is no time consumed for a problem that is not solved.</li> <li>Each program will be tested based on our critical test data. A program will be considered as correct if its output matches with our output against our critical test data.</li> <li>Selection of Teams may or may not reflect the Ranking of the Teams. For selection of the team procedure read below.</li> </ul> </div> <div><b>Selection Procedure:</b> <ul> <li>There are 100 slots available for the on-site contest.</li> <li>The teams which could not solve even a single problem in the preliminary contest are eliminated. The remaining teams are ranked according to performance.</li> <li>Assuming there are N number of problems in the preliminary contest, selection of teams for onsite contest is done as follows, subject to the constraint that maximum number of teams from a single institute can not exceed three.</li> <li>Teams solving all the N problems are selected first.</li> <li>The remaining slots will be filled by selecting top ranking team from each institute according to the rank after removal of the teams selected in Step 1.</li> <li>If slots are still available, the second ranking team from each institute will be selected according to rank. This procedure will continue to third ranking teams in each institute (subject to above constraint), if vacancy exists.</li> <li>If number of teams selected thus exceeds number of slots at any stage, the lowest ranking teams will be removed.</li> </ul> </div> </div> <div><b>Programming Environment:</b> <ul> <li>Programs are to be written in C, C++ or Java. You can find about the compiler options in each language <a href=\"/wiki/list-compilers\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</li> <li>For C/C++ programs use GNU C/ GNU C++ (Command: gcc/g++ file.c) compilers. (For C use gcc-4.8.1 compiler, for C++ use gcc-4.8.1 compiler, for C++ 11, use\u00a0gcc-4.8.1 compiler with\u00a0\"-std=gnu++0x\" option)</li> <li>For Java programs, use JDK 1.7.0_25. Use the usual commands: javac for compilation and java for running the program.</li> </ul> </div> </div>",
