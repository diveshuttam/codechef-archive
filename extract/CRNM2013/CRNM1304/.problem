Sherlock Holmes has been called to help extinguish the fires as quickly as possible. There are exactly N fire stations in the city, each having infinite amount of fire trucks. But the time taken by each fire station to fill a truck is different and the fire stations can only fill one truck at a time. Initially all the fire trucks are empty.</p>\n<p>Given the time taken by each fire station to fill one truck and the time taken for a fire truck to reach the j<sup>th</sup> place from the i<sup>th</sup> fire station, Sherlock needs to tell the minimum time taken to extinguish the fire at all places.</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>\nFirst line contains <b>T</b>,(T&lt;=50) the no. of test cases.<br /><br />\nEach line of first test case contains two integers N and M,(N,M &lt;=50) where N denotes the no. of fire stations and M denotes the no. of places under fire.<br /><br />\nNext line contains N space separated integers, where the i<sup>th</sup> integer denotes the time taken (1&lt;=time taken&lt;=20) by i<sup>th</sup> fire station to fill one truck.<br /><br />\nThen next N lines will follow, each containing M integers, where the integer at i<sup>th</sup> row and j<sup>th</sup> column denotes the time taken (1&lt;=time taken&lt;=20) by a fire truck from i<sup>th</sup> fire station to reach j<sup>th</sup> place.</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>Output of each test case is a single line denoting the minimum time required to extinguish the fire completely.</p>\n<h3>Note</h3>\n<p>\nConsider that as soon as a fire truck reaches the place, the fire extinguishes there in no time. <br /><br />\nEach place will require exactly one truck to extinguish the fire.<br /><br />\nFire truck once used can not be used again.<br /><br />\nThere are infinite number of fire trucks at every station.<br /></p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre>\n<b>Input:</b>\n1\n3 4\n2 5 4\n1 2 3 1\n2 3 1 2\n2 2 3 1\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n6\n</pre><h3>Explanation:</h3>\n<p>The 1<sup>st</sup> fire station sends trucks to both 1<sup>st</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> place. Time Taken=5<br /><br />\nThe 2<sup>nd</sup> fire station sends a truck to 3<sup>rd</sup> place. Time Taken=6<br /><br />\nThe 3<sup>rd</sup> fire station sends a truck to 2<sup>nd</sup> place. Time Taken=6</p>\n",
