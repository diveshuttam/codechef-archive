He also jogs every morning to keep in shape, much to the delight of his fans. In order to maintain a good physique, while at the same time, avoid washing clothes Geek has a huge collection of socks.</p>\n<p>His collection consists of <B>N</B> socks. Each sock has a positive number sewn on it. It is well-known that there is only thing that frightens Geek: wearing a pair of socks with numbers that add up to a multiple of <B>K</B> which is known as the number of paranoia. </p>\n<p>You are given with the number on each of Geek\u2019s sock and <B>K</B>. Your task is to help Geek find the size of the largest subset of his sock collection from which he can pick any two socks without the fear of the numbers on them adding up to a multiple of <B>K</B>.</p>\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The first line of the input contains an integer <B>T</B> denoting the number of test cases. 2<B>T</B> lines follow.</p>\n<p>The first line of each test case contains two numbers <B>N</B> and <B>K</B>, which are the number of socks in Geek\u2019s sock collection and the number of paranoia respectively.</p>\n<p>The second line contains <B>N</B> space-separated integers a<sub>1</sub>, a<sub>2</sub>, a<sub>3</sub>, \u2026, a<sub>N</sub> denoting the numbers on socks.</p>\n\n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>For each test case, output a single line containing the size of the subset of his sock collection from which he can pick any two sock without the fear of the numbers on them adding up to a multiple of <B>K</B>.</p>\n\n\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>T</b> \u2264 <b> 20 </b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>N</b> \u2264 <b> 10^6 </b></li>\n<li><b>2</b> \u2264 <b>K</b> \u2264 <b> 10^6 </b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>a<sub>i<sub></b> \u2264 <b> 10^18 </b></li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n2\n5 4\n1 9 6 4 9\n3 2\n9 7 2\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n5\n2\n</pre>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p><b>Example case 1.</b> Any pair can be picked without forming a multiple of 4.</p>\n<p><b>Example case 2.</b> The subsets are {9, 2} and {7,2}. {9, 7, 2} is not possible because if 9 and 7 are picked they add up to 16 which is a multiple of 2.</p>",
