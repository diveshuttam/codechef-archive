The distance between two consecutive elements is 1 unit.  Four \u20181\u2019s are placed at the four corners of the matrix denoting the presence of four positive point charges there. </p>\n<p>\nThis problem involves approximating the locations Goldilock\u2019s points, defined as those points where the net electric field due to the four point charges is zero. Such points exist either only between 2 elements of a row or two elements of a column. Find out the elements of the matrix between which there exists a Goldilocks point.\n</p><p>\nAssume that the force due to a point charge is 1/d^2(radially outward)   and the potential is given by 1/d (d is the euclidean distance given by ((x1-x2)^2+(y1-y2)^2)^\u00bd . So here x1 , y1 corresponds to the element (i,j) of the matrix. \n</p><p>\nNote - Exclude the Goldilock\u2019s point at the center of the matrix. \n</p></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>n (for n cross n matrix , n is an odd integer <=5001).</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p> \n</p><p>\nK  lines which give 4 spaced integers i j k l denoting points (i,j) and (k,l) between which there exist Goldilock's points. \n</p>Note: Print rows first , points being printed left to right.\nThen print Columns , points being printed top to bottom.\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input: 5</b>\n<b>Output:\n2 0 2 1\n2 3 2 4\n0 2 1 2\n3 2 4 2 \n</b>",
