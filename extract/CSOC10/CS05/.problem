The symbols i, v, x, l and c represent the decimal values 1, 5, 10, 50 and\n100 respectively. To represent other values, these symbols, and multiples where\nnecessary, are concatenated, with the smaller valued symbols written further to the\nright. For example, the number 3 is represented as \"iii\", and the value 73 is\nrepresented as \"lxxiii\". The exceptions to this rule occur for numbers having units\nvalues of 4 to 9, and for tens values of 40 or 90. For these cases, the Roman\nnumerals representations are \"iv\" (4), \"ix\" (9), \"xl\" (40) and \"xc\" (90). So the\nRoman numeral representations for 24,39,44,49 and 94 are xxiv, xxxix, xliv, xlix and\nxciv respectively.\nThe preface of many books have pages numbered with Roman numerals,\nstarting with \"i\" for the first page of the preface, and continuing in sequence. Assume\nbooks with pages having 100 or fewer pages of preface. How many i, v, x, l and c\ncharacters are required to number the pages in the preface? For example, in a five\npage preface we'll use the Roman numerals i, ii, iii, iv and v, meaning we need 7 i\ncharacters and 2 v characters.\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>Input description...\nThe input will consists of a sequence of integers in the range 1 to 100,\nterminated by a zero. For each integer, excepts the final zero, determine the number\nof different types of characters needed to number the prefix pages with Roman\nnumerals\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>Output description...\nFor each integer in the input, write one line containing the five counts\nin the order i, v, x, l, c.\n<h3>Example</h3>\n\n<pre>\n<b>Input:</b>\n2\n20\n99\n0\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n3 0 0 0 0\n28 10 14 0 0\n140 50 150 50 10\n</pre>\n",
