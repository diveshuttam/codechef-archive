The edges of the\npolygon are made of mirrors. As a result, when a ray of light falls upon an edge, it is\nreflected to another direction according to the laws of reflection. So after a certain\nnumber of reflections we can evaluate the point hit by ray. Our challenge here is to\nevaluate that point. By the way, if the ray falls upon a vertex of the polygon, it is lost\nforever.\n<h3>Input</h3>\n</p><p>Input description...\nThe input session begins with two numbers 3&lt;=v&lt;=10, 0&lt;=n&lt;=1000, denoting the\nnumber of vertices in the polygon and the number of reflections to simulate. After\nthat a line will follow containing (x,y), the position of the light emitting point, which\nwill always lie upon an edge (and will never coincide with any vertex) and\n0&lt;=t&lt;360, the angle in degree between x-axis and the ray, measured in anticlockwise\ndirection, which is always valid. Next there be v lines each of which will\ncontain a vertex of the polygon ordered to the anti-clockwise direction. All points will\nbe represented in x,y coordinate system with two digits after the decimal point. A\npair of zeros declares the end of the input session.\n<h3>Output</h3>\n</p><p>Output description...\nFor every data-set, output the final point the array hits after n reflections with two\ndigits after the decimal point. Remember, the point should lie upon an edge of the\npolygon. If the ray is lost forever within n reflections, output \u201clost forever\u2026\u201d. Output\nfor every data-set should start in a new line. Be extra cautious about precision\nerrors. Because if there is a vertex 4.00 and our ray passes through 4.001, we will\ncount it as \u201clost forever\u2026\u201d, as we are concerned with only two digits after the\ndecimal point.\n<h3>Example</h3>\n\n<pre>\n<b>Input:</b>\n4 4\n2.00 0.00 0.00\n0.00 0.00\n4.00 0.00\n4.00 4.00\n0.00 4.00\n4 0\n2.00 0.00 45.00\n0.00 0.00\n4.00 0.00\n4.00 4.00\n0.00 4.00\n0 0\n\n<b>Output:</b>\nLost forever\u2026\n4.00 2.00\n</pre></p>",
