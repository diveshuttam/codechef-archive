    "body": "<p>Problem text...\nAn anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of another word or\nphrase. For example, \u201ccarthorse\u201d is an anagram of \u201corchestra\u201d. Blanks within a\nphrase are ignored in forming anagrams. Thus, \u201corchestra\u201d and \u201chorse cart\u201d are also\nanagrams.\nWrite a program that read a list of phrases and prints all pairs of anagrams occurring\nin the list.\n<h3>Input</h3>\n</p><p>Input description...\nThe Input file will contain a single integer at the first line of the input, indicate the\nnumber of test case you need to test followed by a blank line. Each test case will\nconsist of from 1 to 100 lines. A completely empty or blank line signals the end of a\ntest case. Each line constitutes one phrase.\n<h3>Output</h3>\n</p><p>Output description...\nSome number of lines (including possibly 0 if there are no anagrams in the list), each\nline containing two anagrammatic phrases separated by \u2018=\u2019.\nEach anagram pair should be printed exactly once, and the order of the two phrases\nwithin a printed pair must be lexicographic, as well as the first phrases and the\nsecond ones in case some first are equal.\nTwo consecutive outputs for two consecutive inputs is separated by a single blank\nline.\n<h3>Example</h3>\n\n<pre>\n<b>Input:</b>\n1\ncarthorse\nhorse\nhorse cart\ni do not know u\nok i now donut\norchestra\n\n<b>Output:</b>\ncarthorse = horse cart\ncarthorse = orchestra\nhorse cart = orchestra\ni do not know you = ok i now donut\n</pre></p>",
