For\neach pair of neighboring cities there is a bus service that runs only between those\ntwo cities and uses the road that directly connects them. Each bus service has a limit\non the maximum number of passengers it can carry. Mr. G. has a map showing the\ncities and the roads connecting them. He also has the information regarding each\nbus service. He understands that it may not always be possible for him to take all\nthe tourists to the destination city in a single trip.\nBut Mr. G. finds it difficult to find the best route himself so that he may be\nable to take all the tourists to the destination city in minimum number of trips. So,\nhe seeks your help.\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>Input description...\nThe input will contain one or more test cases. The first line of each test\ncase will contain two positive integers N (1<N<=100) and R representing\nrespectively the number of cities and the number of road segment. Then R lines will\nfollow each containing three integers C1, C2 and P. C1 and C2 are the city numbers\nand P (P>1) is the limit on the maximum number of passengers to be carried by the\nbus between the two cities. City numbers are positive integers ranging from 1 to N.\n2 5\n1 4 7\n3 6\n30\n15\n60\n20\n30\n20\n10 35\n25\n40\nthe (R+1)th line will contain three integers S, D and T representing respectively the\nstarting city, the destination city and the number of tourists to be guided.\nThe input will end with two zeroes for N and R.\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>Output description...\nFor each test case in the input output the minimum number of trips\nrequired on a separate line.\n<h3>Example</h3>\n\n<pre>\n<b>Input:</b>\n7 10\n1 2 30\n1 3 15\n1 4 10\n2 4 25\n2 5 60\n3 4 40\n3 6 20\n4 7 35\n5 7 20\n6 7 30\n1 7 99\n3 2\n1 2 15\n2 3 10\n1 3 30\n0 0\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n4\n3\n</pre>\n",
