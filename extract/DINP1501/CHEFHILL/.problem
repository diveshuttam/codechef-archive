There are N mountains lined up in a straight line . Each mountain has a height h[i] . Chef is currently at mountain a and wants to go to mountain b . He can do so by jumping from mountain a to b (he is talented ) . But he can jump from a to b only if there is no mountain between a and b whose height is strictly greater than that of mountain a .</p>\n<p>In this problem , you will be given the array h containing heights of mountains and several queries with a and b , you will have you answer whether chef can jump from a to b or not .\n</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The first line contains an integer N, the next line has N integers denoting the heights of the mountains h[i] . The next line has an integer Q , the number of queries , Then q lines follow each containing 2 integers a and b.</p>\n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>For each query , answer \"YES\" if chef can jump from a to b , otherwise answer \"NO\" if he cant .\n</p>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b>1</b> &lt;= <b>N</b> &lt;= <b>10<sup>5</sup></b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> &lt;= <b>h[i]</b> &lt;= <b>10<sup>4</sup></b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> &lt;= <b>Q</b> &lt;= <b>10<sup>5</sup></b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> &lt;= <b>a</b> &lt;= <b>N</b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> &lt;= <b>b</b> &lt;= <b>N</b></li>\n<li><b>b>a</b></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n5\n2 3 1 2 4\n3\n1 3\n2 5\n2 3\n<b>Output:</b>\nNO\nYES\nYES\n</pre>\n<h3>Explaination</h3>\n<p>For first query the answer is NO because between 1 and 3 , the second mountain is of height 3 which is more than height of mountain 1 which is 2 . For second query there is no mountain more than 3 units high between 2 and 5 so answer is YES. For 3rd query there is no mountain between 2 and 3 so the answer is YES .</p>\n",
