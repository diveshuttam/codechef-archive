Just like the buildings of Mumbai, he wants to build tall buildings and develop his \"Karmabhoomi\" Gopalmath. But, for that he has to first answer several queries asked by minister Bhosle. Help Gaitonde to answer queries correctly.  \n\nYou are given **N** buildings each having some height. The height of i<sub>th</sub> building is **H[i]** where 0 \u2264 i < N. You are also given **Q** queries asked by Bhosle. In each query, a range **[ L , R ]** is provided such that 0 \u2264 L \u2264 R < N. Your task is to find the total number of buildings visible from the left view in the range L to R **both inclusive** for each query.  \n\nLet's say for a given query, the height of buildings in the range L to R are:  \n**{ 5, 2, 4, 7, 7, 9 }**  \nLeft view for this range is depicted in the diagram below:  \n\n![image](https://codechef_shared.s3.amazonaws.com/download/HYC/External_contest_images/INQU2018/GOPALMAT.png)\n\nBuilding of height 2 and 4 are not visible from left view due to taller building of height 5.  \nSimilarly, second last building of height 7 is not visible due to building of height 7 before it.  \nSo, total 3 buildings are visible from left view.\n\n###Input:\n\n- First line contains two space separated integers **N** and **Q** which desribes the number of buildings and the number of queries respectively.\n- Second line contains **N** space separated integers where i<sub>th</sub> integer describes the height of i<sub>th</sub> building, i.e. **H[i]**.\n- Next Q lines contains two space separated integers **A** and **B**.  \n\n###Important Note:\n\n**You have to calculate L and R for each query using A and B along with answer of previous query in the given below manner:** \n\nL = (A+ans) mod N;                                               \nR = (B+ans) mod N;       \nif(L>R)                      \n    swap(L,R);           \n\nwhere **ans** is the output of previous query.  \n**Note: For first query, ans=0.**\n\n###Output:\nOutput Q lines where each line contains an integer which depicts the total number of buildings visible from left view in the range [L,R] of that query.\n\n###Constraints: \n1 \u2264 N \u2264 10<sup>5</sup>     \n1 \u2264 Q \u2264 10<sup>5</sup>         \n1 \u2264 H[i] \u2264 10<sup>9</sup>  ,where  0 \u2264 i < N     \n0 \u2264 A \u2264 B < N          \n###Sample Input:\n8 4                \n5 1 2 7 6 7 3 9                 \n0 7                 \n2 6          \n3 4            \n0 3       \n\n###Sample Output:\n3  \n3  \n2  \n2  \n",
