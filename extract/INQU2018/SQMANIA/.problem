Gaitonde has left clues for Sartaj in the form of puzzles. Sartaj must solve a puzzle in order to get next clue. Sartaj has solved all the puzzles except the last one. Help Sartaj in solving the last puzzle and save the world.\n\nThe puzzle is:\n\n**N** squares of different sizes are placed on a horizontal line in a 2-d plane. Adjacent squares are separated by some distance. You have to draw all the squares **without** lifting the pencil such that the total distance travelled by the pencil is **minimum**. \nEach time you have to start drawing from the *bottom-left corner of leftmost square*.\n\n**Note that, before starting to draw a square, all the squares to the left of it must be drawn completely.**\n\nThe below sequence of picture describe a possible way to draw the squares without lifting the pencil:\n\n![image](https://codechef_shared.s3.amazonaws.com/download/HYC/External_contest_images/INQU2018/SQMANIA.png)\n\n###Input:\n\n- First line contains an integer **n** decribing the number of square.\n- Second line contains **n** integers, *i<sup>th</sup>* integer describe the length of side of *i<sup>th</sup>* square.\n- Third line contains **n-1** integers, *i<sup>th</sup>* integer describe the distance between *i<sup>th</sup>* and *(i+1)<sup>th</sup>* square.\n- *If n = 1 then the input contains only two lines.*\n###Output:\n\nOutput a single number which is the **minimum length** that needs to be drawn to draw all the squares **without lifting the pencil**.\n\n*If the output is not an integer then return the maximum integer less than or equal to the output value.*\n\n###Constraints \n- 1 <= n <= 10<sup>5</sup>\n- 1 <= side-length of square <= 10<sup>9</sup>\n- 0 <= distance between two squares <= 10<sup>9</sup>\n\n###Sample Input 0:\n1      \n10\n\n###Sample Output 0:\n40\n\n###Explanation 0:\nSince the input contains only one square, so the minimum possible length is simply the perimeter of the square which is 40.",
