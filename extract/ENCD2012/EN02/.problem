The balls are placed in a\nsequence, and Stark wants to sort them (in ascending order). He has a device to manipulate\nthe balls, which performs the following operation. Stark can select a subset of balls, and the\ndevice will lift the selected subset, shift the selected subset to the right (keeping the order\nin the subset), shift the not-selected subset to the left, filling up empty spaces (keeping the\norder in the subset), then finally move the raised balls to be in one level again.\n\nFor example: \nIf Stark has the sequence: 3,5,1,2,8,7,6,4 and selects the subset in bold:\n<b>3</b>,<b>5</b>,1,2,<b>8</b>,7,<b>6</b>,4 then the result is: 1,2,7,4,3,5,8,6.\n\nHelp stark to write a program that will calculate the minimal number of moves required to\nsort the given sequence of balls in ascending order of numbers.\n\n<b>Input</b>\nFirst line of input contains the number of test cases t, 1 \u2264 t \u2264 10. Then, t test cases follow.\nEach test case starts with 1 to 105 (the number of balls) followed by the n integer values\ndescribing the number on ball in the sequence.\n\n<b>Output</b>\nFor each test case, in a separate line, print the answer to that test case i.e. minimum\nnumber of moves.\n\n<b>Example</b>\n\n<b>Input:</b>\n1\n6 1 3 5 2 4 6\n<b>Output:</b>\n2\n</pre>",
