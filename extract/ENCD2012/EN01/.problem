During rains, many species find it\ndifficult to survive, so he decided to erect a large shed in the Sanctuary (a rectangular field)\nto protect these species. However, there are a number of trees on this land and Dexter does\nnot wish to cut any of them.\n\nHere is a description of Sanctuary as a rectangular grid where \".\" indicates the absence of\na tree and \" T \" indicates the presence of a tree.\n\n. . . . . T . .\n. T . . T . . .\n. . . . . T . .\nT . . . . . . .\n. . . . . . . .\n. . . . . T . .\n. . T . . . . .\n\nIn this case, Dexter can build a 4 \u00d74 square shed, as indicated below:\n\n. . . . . T . .\n. T . . T . . .\n. s s s s T . .\nT s s s s . . .\n. s s s s . . .\n. s s s s T . .\n. . T . . . . .\n\nYou may verify that this is the largest square shed he can put up without cutting any trees.\nYour task is to help Dexter determine the area of the largest shed he can put up without\ncutting any trees.\n\n<b>Input format</b>\nThe first line of input contains two integers M and N indicating the dimensions of the\nSanctuary. This is followed by M lines of input, each containing N letters each of which is a\n\".\" or a \"T\".\n\n<b>Output format</b>\nThe output consists of a single line with a single integer indicating the area of the largest\nsquare shed that Dexter can put up in Sanctuary without cutting any trees. Also return -1 if\nnot possible to erect the square shed.\n\n<b>Constraints</b>\nYou may assume that M \u22641000 and N \u22641000 in all inputs.\n\n<b>Example</b>\n\nWe now illustrate the input and output formats using the above example.\n\n<b>Sample input</b>\n\n7 8\n.....T..\n.T..T...\n.....T..\nT.......\n........\n.....T..\n..T.....\n\n<b>Sample output</b>\n16\n</pre>",
