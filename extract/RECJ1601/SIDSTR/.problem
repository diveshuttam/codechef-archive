Meanwhile, her friend asks her to solve another problem. Since Gargi is busy in her own problem, she seeks your help to solve the new problem.<br />\nYou are given a string S containing characters a-z <b>(lower case letters) only</b>. You need to change the string to a new string consisting of only one letter from a-z.<br />\nFor a given character S[i] in the string, if you change it to a character having lower ASCII value than the character S[i], you gain points equal to the difference in ASCII value of the old character and the new character. Similarly, for a given character S[j] in the string, if you change it to a character having higher ASCII value than the character S[j], you lose points equal to the difference in ASCII value of the old character and the new character.<br />\nHowever, Gargi does not like gaining or losing points. She has asked you to change the string in such a way that the total losing or gaining of points at the end of the string conversion is minimum.<br />\nGive Gargi the <b>absolute</b> value of the points you have at the end of the string conversion.\n</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The first line of the input contains an integer <b>T</b> denoting the number of test cases. The description of <b>T</b> test cases follows.\n</p>\n<p>The first line of each of the T test case contains a string <b>S</b> containing only lower case characters (a-z)\n</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>For each test case, output a single line containing the answer.</p>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>T</b> \u2264 <b>10</b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>|S|</b> \u2264 <b>100000</b></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n1\nabba\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n2\n</pre><h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p><b>Example case 1.</b> The new string can be <b>aaaa</b> where you have +2 points at the end of string conversion or it can be <b>bbbb</b> where you have -2 points at the end of string conversion. Hence the output is 2.</p>\n",
