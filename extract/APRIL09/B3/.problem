All user submissions for this contest problem are publicly available <a href=\"http://www.codechef.com/APRIL09/status/B3/\">here</a>.</b></p>\n\n<p>In the game of \"BattleShip V\", you control a cannon which is attacking a large enemy battleship, armed with many guns. Your goal is to destroy as many of the guns as possible.</p>\n<p>The battle field is a 2D Cartesian grid, where your cannon is located at the origin.</p>\n<p>The enemy battleship is a horizontal line segment located from the coordinates (X1 , Y) to (X2, Y). \nThere are exactly (X2 - X1 + 1) guns on the ship, located at the integer points (X1, Y), (X1+1, Y), ..., (X2, Y).\n</p>\n<p>\nHowever, the problem is, you cannot always fire at a gun. There are supernatural rocks located at all points of the battlefield whose X and Y coordinates are both integers. In order to fire successfully at an enemy's gun, the line connecting your cannon and that gun must not \ngo through any rocks.\n</p>\n<p>\nHow many guns you successfully destroy?\n</p>\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>\nThe first line contains t, the number of test cases (about 100). Then t test cases follow.\n</p>\n<p>\nEach test case consists of one line containing three numbers Y, and X1, X2 (2100000000 > &#8804; Y &#8804; 2100000000, -2100000000 &#8804; X <sub>1</sub> &#8804; X<sub>2</sub> &#8804; 2100000000).\n</p>\n\n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>\nFor each test case, output the number of the enemy battleship's guns that your cannon can destroy.\n</p>\n\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre>\n<b>Input</b>\n1\n2 -2 1\n\n\n<b>Output</b>\n2\n</pre>",
