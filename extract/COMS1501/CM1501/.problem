While searching for the artifact in a jungle,<br />\n    Indy discovers a hidden rectangular pool divided into NxM cells. In some cells of the pool there are stone islands. Each island consists of some number of<br />\n    stones. Let's call this number the height of the island. Indy can jump from the island with coordinates (x,y) to any island with coordinates (x+1,y),<br />\n    (x+2,y), (x-1,y), (x-2,y), (x,y+1), (x,y+2), (x,y-1), (x,y-2). When he jumps off the island its height goes down by one. If the height of any island<br />\n    becomes 0 it goes underwater and he can't jump on it any more. Assume that Indy starts on an island with coordinates (sx, sy). The goal is to make all the<br />\n    islands (except the final one) go underwater and finish on the island with coordinates (fx, fy) which should have height equal to 1 when you finish on it.<br />\n    When this task is completed, the door to the Ark of The Covenant will open. Your task is to help Indy find the number of different ways to achieve his<br />\n    goal.\n</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">\n    Input<br />\n</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n    The first line of input file contains number t - the number of test cases. Then the description of each test case follows. The first line of each test case<br />\n    contains numbers N and M. The next line contains two coordinates sx and sy of the start cell. After that there are two coordinates fx and fy of the<br />\n    finishing cell. Then N lines follow each consisting of M integers denoting the heights of the islands in each cell of the pool. The height 0 means that<br />\n    there is no island in the cell. Note also that each test case in the official tests will be generated by the following procedure. The dimensions of the<br />\n    pool will be chosen randomly and uniformly: N and M will be from 3 to 8 inclusive. Then the final cell will be chosen randomly: fx will be from 1 to N and<br />\n    fy will be from 1 to M. The height of island in the cell (fx, fy) will be set to 1. Then the number of jumps will chosen randomly from 15 to 25. Then this<br />\n    many random valid jumps will be performed adding one stone to the cell the jumps lands on. The cell on which we land after performing all the jumps will be<br />\n    proclaimed as the initial cell: (sx, sy).\n</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">\n    Output<br />\n</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\n    For each test case print the total number of different ways to solve the task.\n</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">\n    Example<br />\n</h3>\n<p>\n    Input:\n</p>\n<p><br/></br/></p>\n<p>\n    1\n</p>\n<p><br/></br/></p>\n<p>\n    3 3\n</p>\n<p><br/></br/></p>\n<p>\n    3 1\n</p>\n<p><br/></br/></p>\n<p>\n    3 1\n</p>\n<p><br/></br/></p>\n<p>\n    1 0 0\n</p>\n<p><br/></br/></p>\n<p>\n    3 1 1\n</p>\n<p><br/></br/></p>\n<p>\n    3 1 1\n</p>\n<p><br/><br />\n<br/></br/></br/></p>\n<p>\n    Output:\n</p>\n<p><br/></br/></p>\n<p>\n    152\n</p>\n",
