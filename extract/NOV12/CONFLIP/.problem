After a lot of research, Little Elephant came to know that most of the animals in the forest were showing less interest to play the multi-player games.Little Elephant had started to invent single player games, and succeeded in inventing the new single player game named <b>COIN FLIP</b>.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIn this game the player will use <b>N</b> coins numbered from <b>1</b> to <b>N</b>, and all the coins will be facing in \"Same direction\" (Either <b>Head</b> or <b>Tail</b>),which will be decided by the player before starting of the game.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe player needs to play <b>N</b> rounds.In the <b>k</b>-th round the player will flip the face of the all coins whose number is less than or equal to <b>k</b>. That is, the face of coin <b>i</b> will be reversed, from <b>Head</b> to <b>Tail</b>, or, from <b>Tail</b> to <b>Head</b>, for <b>i</b> \u2264 <b>k</b>.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nElephant needs to guess the total number of coins showing a particular face after playing <b>N</b> rounds. Elephant really becomes quite fond of this game <b>COIN FLIP</b>, so Elephant plays <b>G</b> times. Please help the Elephant to find out the answer.\n</p>\n\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>\nThe first line of input contains an integer <b>T</b>, denoting the number of test cases.\nThen <b>T</b> test cases follow.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe first line of each test contains an integer <b>G</b>, denoting the number of games played by Elephant. Each of the following <b>G</b> lines denotes a single game, and contains 3 space separeted integers <b>I</b>, <b>N</b>, <b>Q</b>, where <b>I</b> denotes the initial state of the coins, <b>N</b> denotes the number of coins and rounds, and <b>Q</b>, which is either 1, or 2 as explained below.\n\n<p>\nHere <b>I=1</b> means all coins are showing <b>Head</b> in the start of the game, and <b>I=2</b> means all coins are showing <b>Tail</b> in the start of the game. <b>Q=1</b> means Elephant needs to guess the total number of coins showing <b>Head</b> in the end of the game, and <b>Q=2</b> means Elephant needs to guess the total number of coins showing <b>Tail</b> in the end of the game.\n</p>\n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>\nFor each game, output one integer denoting the total number of coins showing the particular face in the end of the game.\n</p>\n\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n\n<p>\n<b>1 \u2264 T \u2264 10</b><br>\n<b>1 \u2264 G \u2264 20000</b><br>\n<b>1 \u2264 N \u2264 10<sup>9</sup></b><br>\n<b>1 \u2264 I \u2264 2</b><br>\n<b>1 \u2264 Q \u2264 2</b><br>\n</p>\n\n<pre>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<b>Input:</b>\n1\n2\n1 5 1\n1 5 2\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n2\n3\n</pre>\n\n<h3>Explanation:</h3>\n<p>\n<b>In the 1st game in Example:</b>\n<b>I=1</b>, so initial arrangement of coins are H H H H H,\nand now Elephant will play 5 rounds and coin faces will be changed as follows<br>\nAfter the 1st Round: <b>T</b> H H H H<br>\nAfter the 2nd Round: <b>H T</b> H H H<br>\nAfter the 3rd Round: <b>T H T</b> H H<br>\nAfter the 4th Round: <b>H T H T</b> H<br>\nAfter the 5th Round: <b>T H T H T</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nFinally <b>Q=1</b>, so we need to find the total number of coins showing <b>Head</b>, which is <b>2</b>.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n<b>In the 2nd game in Example:</b>\nThis is similar to the 1st game, except Elephant needs to find the total number of coins showing <b>Tail</b>.\nSo the Answer is <b>3</b>. (Please see the final state of the coins in the 1st game)\n</p>\n",
