The building is represented by a square and the roof by an isosceles triangle in the coordinate system.\nFormally, the following conditions are guaranteed:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Both the square and the triangle are non-degenerate, i.e their areas are positive, and not zero.</li>\n<li>The bottom side of the triangle is its base.</li>\n<li>The bottom side of the square lies on the x-axis, while the top side is a part of the base of the triangle.</li>\n<li>The base of the triangle is longer that the side of the square.</li>\n<li>The whole drawing is symmetric with respect to the y-axis.</li>\n<li>All vertices of the square and the triangle have integer coordinates, and their absolute values do not exceed 1000.\nAll y-coordinates are non-negative.</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n\n<p>An example of a valid drawing: </p>\n\n<img src=\"https://www.codechef.com/download/upload/LTIME45/1YdgYQi.png\" height=\"280\" width=\"440\"/>\n\n<p>\nYour task is to find the total area of the house (the sum of areas of the square and the triangle).\nTo achieve that, you are allowed to ask at most 100 queries.\nIn each query you choose some point with integer coordinates and the system will tell you if this point is in the house (including its boundary).\n</p>\n\n<h3>Interaction</h3>\n\n<p>At most 100 times, you can ask a query by printing \"? x y\" (without the quotes) in a singe line.\nCoordinates x and y should be integers such that -1000 \u2264 x \u2264 1000 and 0 \u2264 y \u2264 1000.\nAfter flushing the output you should read a response that is a string \"YES\" or \"NO\" (without the quotes) in a single line.\nA response \"YES\" means that the point (x, y) is inside the house or on its boundary, while \"NO\" means that it's outside.</p>\n\n<p>Finally you should print the answer in the form \"! S\" (without the quotes) where S is an integer denoting the area of the house (it can be proved that it must be integer).\nThen terminate your program.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Notes</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>For each test the house is fixed and it doesn't change during queries.\nIt's even allowed to guess the area and print the answer as \"! S\" without asking any queries.\nBut obviously asking queries first might be useful.</li>\n<li>After submitting your program you will see which tests it passes.\nThe first test there (\"task # 0\") matches the example test and drawings from this statement.</li>\n<li>Asking more than 100 queries or printing invalid coordinates (not from allowed range) results in the verdict WA (wrong answer).</li>\n<li>Printing the answer doesn't count as asking a query.\nIn particular, you can ask exactly 100 queries and print the answer after that .</li>\n<li>You can't ask more queries after printing the answer.</li>\n<li>You can ask the same query more than once.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>Subtasks</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Subtask #1 (35 points) The absolute values of the coordinates of vertices don't exceed 10.</li>\n<li>Subtask #2 (65 points) Original constraints (absolute values of coordinates can be up to 1000)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>Example</h3>\n\n<table border=\"1\">\n<tr>\n<td>you</td>     <td>system</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>? 1 0 </td> <td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td> <td>YES</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>? 2 2 </td> <td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td> <td>YES</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>? -3 0 </td> <td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td> <td>NO</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>? -1 3</td> <td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td> <td>YES</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>? -1 4</td> <td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td> <td>YES</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>? 7 4</td> <td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td> <td>NO</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>? -3 6</td> <td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td> <td>NO</td>\n</tr>\n\n\n\n<tr>\n<td>? 2 6</td> <td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td> <td>YES</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>! 34</td> <td></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n<h3>Explanation</h3>\n\n<p>The example test matches the drawing from the statement.\nThe square has side 4, while the triangle has base 12 and height 3.\nThe answer is 4 * 4 + 12 * 3 / 2 = 16 + 18 = 34.</p>\n\n<p>Above you can see an example of communication with the system.\nFor example, the first query asks about the point (1, 0).\nIt is on the boundary so the response is \"YES\".\nOn the drawing below, blue and red points denote queries with response \"YES\" and \"NO\" respectively. </p>\n\n<img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/codechef_shared/download/upload/LTIME45/QoJ5ejY.png\" height=\"280\" width=\"440\"/>",
