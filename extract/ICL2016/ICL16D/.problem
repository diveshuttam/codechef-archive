He plays it all day, taking only tea breaks in between.</p>\n<p>He take T tea breaks on a particular day (He plays for T+1 sessions). Between any 2 tea breaks he has to pass N difficulty levels. Pocket Tanks is a game where the player has to move his/her tank to a specific place. The number of moves he can make in a game always lie between [1, K]. This K and N is given to him by her friend Alice during the tea break (They always have tea together ;).</p>\n<p>Given a number X at the start of day, he has to find the number of ways to get this number (X) as a sum of moves for N games he plays in one session. He then sums up this value for all the sessions he plays. If the final value Y % 1000000007 is correct, he wins.</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The first line will contain two integers <em>T</em> and <em>X</em>.</p>\n<p>Each of the next T+1 lines contain a two integers <em>N</em> and <em>K</em>.</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>Print one integer corresponding to the answer (Y) modulo 1000000007.</p>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<p>0 &lt;= <em>T</em> &lt;= 10</p>\n<p>1 &lt;= (<em>N</em> * <em>K</em>) &lt;= 10000</p>\n<p>1 &lt;= <em>X</em> &lt;= 1000</p>\n<h3>Sample input</h3>\n<pre><code>0 8\n3 6</code></pre><h3>Sample output</h3>\n<pre><code>21</code></pre><h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p>As per the testcase, Bob has 0 tea breaks, so he plays just one session. In that session he has to play 3 levels and with a maximum of 6 moves per level. He can either make 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 moves in each level. Finally he has to make such moves that he is able to make a total of 8 moves. Since he plays for only one session, he has to make a total of 8 moves after 3 levels to win.</p>\n<p>The number of ways in which he can make such moves is 21.</p>\n",
