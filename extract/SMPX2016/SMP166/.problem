They need to be trained so that they can perform better in unknown situations.\n\nMostly they are fighting and grass pokemons. \n\nSo the first instruction they are given is to preacefully have dinner. \n\nTo do that, they are made to sit in a round table with at max N chairs around it.\n\nThere are <b>E(>= N)</b> number of grass pokemons and <b>H(>= N)</b> number of fighting pokemons.\n\nThere could be many ways to sit but we cannot let two fighting types to sit side by side, or else there will be commotion.\n\nNow we are interested to know the number of valid arrangements possible given you can not distinguish between any two members of a type. \n\nAs answer could be very large, output the answer <b>modulo 10^9+7</b>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>First line of the input file contains number of test cases <b>T</b>. Each line of the next T lines represents a test case. Each test case contains <b>N</b>, <b>E</b> and <b>H</b> respectively.</p>\n\n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>For each test case output the number of arrangements possible(modulo 10<sup>9</sup>+7) in a new line.</p>\n\n\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>T</b> \u2264 <b>10<sup>3</sup></b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>N</b> \u2264 <b>10<sup>6</sup></b></li>\n<li><b>N</b> \u2264 <b>E</b>   ;  <b>H</b> \u2264 <b>2*N</b></li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n1\n3 4 5\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n4\n</pre>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p>If G represents a grass member and F represents a fighting member then there are following valid arrangements:<br>\nGGG<br>\nGGF<br>\nGFG<br>\nFGG<br>\n<br>\nGFG and GGF are different arrangements as the chairs are different. Its just that you cannot distinguish between two members of a type. \n",
