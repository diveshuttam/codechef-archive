    "body": "<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Pikachu and Charmander are great friends. Both are Somesh's Pokemon (Pokemon are just like pets!). Somesh gives them special food to eat , called Pokeblocks, which increases their strength and cuteness. Each Pokeblock has a value written on it that signifies how good it is for the Pokemon (naturally, higher the value ,the better it is!).\n\nOne morning when Somesh was asleep, Pikachu woke up and found <b>N</b> Pokeblocks of arbitrary values <b>a<sub>1</sub>,a<sub>2</sub>.....,a<sub>N</sub></b>. Somesh usually distributes Pokeblocks between Pikachu and Charmander in a way so that both of them get equal nutrition. But since today Somesh is asleep, Pikachu decides to eat the Pokeblocks in such a way that he will get more nutrition than Charmander. Thus, total value received by Pikachu will be strictly greater than what is left for Charmander.</br>But Charmander is Pikachu's friend, so Pikachu doesn't want to leave very few Pokeblocks for Charmander. Therefore, Pikachu decides that he will take the minimum number of Pokeblocks which has a total value strictly greater than what is\nleft for Charmander.\nHelp Pikachu find what is the minimum number of Pokeblocks he should eat.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The first line contains integer <b>N</b> \u2014 the number of Pokeblocks.\nThe second line contains a sequence of N integers <b>a<sub>1</sub>, a<sub>2</sub>, ..., a<sub>N</sub> </b> \u2014 the Pokeblocks' values.\nAll numbers are separated with spaces.</p>\n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>In the single line print the single number \u2014 the minimum needed number of Pokeblocks.</p>\n\n\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>N</b> \u2264 <b>10<sup>6</sup></b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>a<sub>i</sub></b> \u2264 <b>10<sup>6</sup></b></li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n2\n3 3\n\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n2\n</pre>\n",
