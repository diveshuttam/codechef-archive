He got excited at the airport and bought a huge cuboidal box (with sides <b>AxBxC</b>) of chocolates. However, the distribution of chocolates inside this box is not uniform. Consider the box to have a 3D coordinate system within it. Suppose you break the cuboidal box into many cubes of dimensions 1x1x1, you can then label coordinates starting from 0, 0, 0 to <b> A, B, C </b>. <br>\nYou are given a matrix of the chocolates in each individual cube. To take out chocolates from the box he needs to put his hand in a particular area. He has a huge hand, so this area can be anywhere between 0x0x0 to <b>AxBxC</b>, depending on his mood. Singlazy is as his name suggests, lazy. Before drawing chocolates from an area he wants to know how many chocolates he will get from the area. He however does not extract these chocolates, he is simply collecting information.<br>\nYou are given the number of chocolates in each coordinate in the 3D box. You are then given <b>Q</b> queries, describing the area about which Singlazy wants to know. Output the answers to the queries.\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>First line has 3 integers: <b>A, B, C</b><br>\nThe next line has the number of chocolates in each coordinate defined as Ch(A1, B1, C1)<br>\nCh1,1,1, Ch1,1,2, ..., Ch1,1,A,<br>\nCh1,2,1, Ch1,2,2, ..., Ch1,2,A,<br>\n...<br>\nCh1,B,1, Ch1,B,2, ..., Ch1,B,A,<Br>\nCh2,1,1, Ch2,1,2, ..., Ch2,1,A,<Br>\n...<Br>\nCh2,B,1, Ch2,B,2, ..., Ch2,B,A,<br>\n...<br>\nChC,B,1, ChC,B,2, ..., ChC,B,A<br>\nThe next line contains an integer <b>Q</b>, the number of Queries.\n<br>\nThe following <b>Q</b> lines have 6 integers <b>A1, B1, C1, A2, B2, C2</b> - the coordinates of two opposite vertices of a part of the box for which the total quantity of chocolates should be calculated.\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>Output description.</p>\n<p>\u00a0For each query, output a single line with the number of chocolates in the area queried. </p>\n\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n1 <= A, B, C <= 100<Br>\nChi,j,k \u2264 2000 chocolates<br>\n<br>\n<b>Subtask 1 (20 points):</b><br>\nQ<=10</b><br>\n<br>\n<b>Subtask 2 (80 points):</b><br>\nQ<=10^5<br>\n\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n3 3 2\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12  13 14 15 16 17 18\n2\n0 0 0 3 3 2\n1 0 1 3 2 2\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n171\n52\n</pre>\n\n<b> Explanation </b>\nFor the first query, Singla can access all cubes between the coordinates 0, 0, 0 and 3, 3, 2. Thus the answer is the sum of all the chocolates in the individual cubes. <br>\nFor the second query, He can Take chocolates from cubes only between the coordinates (1, 0, 1) and (3, 2, 2). You can verify that these add up to 52. The break up being: 11 + 12 + 14 + 15.",
