Exun 2042, DPS RK Puram\u2019s 42nd (assume it was cancelled deliberately for 5 years to sync up ;) ) Tech Festival is coming and Shash is delighted. He decides to pay his employees extra to celebrate the occasion. So he decides to draw a cheque with a value <b>V</b> that is to be distributed amongst his employees. <br>\n<ol>\n<li>V must be an integral value between <b>A</b> and <b>B</b> (inclusive). The number of digits in <b>A</b> and <b>B</b> is equal.\n<li>Suppose Shash assigns 1 based indexing to the digits of this number <b>V</b>. He doesn\u2019t like digits at indexes divisible by <b>K</b>. Neither does he like the digit <b>L</b>. So he puts <b>L</b> only at indexes divisible by <b>K</b>, and nowhere else.\n<li>Shash Evil Incorporative has <b>M</b> employees and 1 teaboy. He must give an equal integral amount to all the <b>M</b> employees and the teaboy must be paid a fixed value <b>X</b>. <b>X</b> will always be less than <b>M</b>. The whole value <b>V</b> should be used up in making this payment. <br>\nFind the number of <b>V\u2019s (mod 1e9+7)</b> that Shash can choose such that these constraints are satisfied.\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The first line contains 4 integers, <b>K, L, M and X</b> as described above. <br>\nThe second line contains the lower limit on <b>V</b> in the form of a string <b>A</b>. <br>\nThe third line contains the upper limit on <b>V</b> in the form of a string <b>B</b>. <br>\n</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>A single integer, the number of possible values <b>mod 1e9+7</b></p>\n\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<p>\n<ul><li>1 <= |A| = |B| <= 1,000\n<li>K>1\n<li>X < M <= 1,000\n<li>0<=L<=9\n</ul>\n</p>\n<b> Subtask 1 (10 Points): </b><br>\n|A|, |B| <= 8\n<br>\n<b> Subtask 2 (20 Points): </b><br>\nM = 2, 5 or 10\n<br>\n<b>Subtask 3 (70 Points) </b> <br>\nOriginal Constraints\n<p>\n<pre><b>Example:</b>\n<b>Sample Input 1</b>:\n2 5 6 2\n100\n199\n\n<b>Sample Output 1:</b>\n2\n\n<b>Explanation 1:</b>\nOnly 2 numbers, 152 and 158 satisfy the constraints. For 152, 30 are given to each employee. For 158, 31 are given to each employee. Both have the digit 5 only in places divisible by 2.\n\n<b>Sample Input 2:</b>\n3 5 5 0\n100\n200\n\n<B>Sample Output 2:</b>\n9\n\n<b>Explanation 2:</b>\n105, 115, 125, 135, 145, 165, 175, 185, 195 are the possible values. Notice that 155 also has 5 in the 2nd place and 2 is not divisible by 3, so it is not counted.\n\n<b>Sample Input 3:</b>\n2 5 2 1 \n1\n9\n\n<b>Sample Output 3:</b>\n4\n\n<b>Explanation 3:</b>\n1 3 7 9 are the possible values. Again notice that 5 cannot be a possible value as it can only be in positions divisible by 2.\n</p>",
