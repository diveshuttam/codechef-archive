At CodeChef, we work hard to revive the geek in you by hosting a programming contest at the start of the month and another smaller programming challenge in the middle of the month.</p> </div> <p><br /><b class=\"rules-heading\">About CodeChef April Long Challenge:</b></p> <div class=\"rules-body\"> <p>CodeChef Long Challenge is a 10 day monthly coding contest where you can show off your computer programming skills. The significance being - it gives you enough time to think about a problem, try different ways of attacking the problem, read the concepts etc. If you\u2019re usually slow at solving problems and have ample time at hand, this is ideal for you. We also put in a lot of efforts in getting quality problems, which would in turn foster your learning while solving them.</p> </div> <p><br /><b class=\"rules-heading\">Contest Details:</b></p> <div class=\"rules-body\"> <ul class=\"\"> <li><b>Problem Setters: </b><span><a href=\"/users/abhra73\" target=\"_blank\">Abhra Dasgupta</a>, <a href=\"/users/m0stik\" target=\"_blank\">Andrii Mostovyi</a>, <a href=\"/users/xellos0\" target=\"_blank\">Jakub Safin</a>, <a href=\"/users/darkshadows\" target=\"_blank\">Lalit Kundu</a>, <a href=\"/users/pavel1996\" target=\"_blank\">Pavel Sheftelevich</a>, <a href=\"/users/dpraveen\" target=\"_blank\">Praveen Dhinwa</a>, <a href=\"/users/xcwgf666\" target=\"_blank\">Sergey Kulik</a>, <a href=\"/users/antoniuk1\" target=\"_blank\">Vasia Antoniuk</a>, <a href=\"/users/witalij_hq\" target=\"_blank\">Vitalij Kozhukhivskij</a></span></li> <li><b>Problem Tester &amp;\u00a0<b>Mandarin Translator</b>: </b><a href=\"/users/xcwgf666\" target=\"_blank\">Sergey Kulik</a></li> <li><b>Editorialist: </b><a href=\"/users/adurysk\" target=\"_blank\">Surya Kiran</a></li> <li><b>Mandarin Translator: </b><a href=\"/users/stzgd\">Gedi Zheng</a></li> <li><b>Duration: </b>10 Days,\u00a0<span>From 3rd April, 2015 at 15:00 HRS (IST) to 13th \u00a0April, 2015 15:00 HRS (IST).\u00a0You\u00a0may check your\u00a0timezone </span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=CodeChef%3A+April+Challenge+2015&amp;iso=20150403T15&amp;p1=44\">here</a><span>.</span></li> <li><b>For ranklist visit: </b><a href=\"/rankings/APRIL15/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.codechef.com/rankings/APRIL15/</a></li> </ul> </div> <p><b class=\"rules-heading\">Eligibility Criteria: Anyone with a knack for Programming :P</b></p> <div class=\"rules-body\"> <p>Our contests are open to all the programmers across the globe.</p> </div> <p>\u00a0</p> <p><b class=\"rules-heading\">What's in it for you?</b></p> <div class=\"rules-body\"> <p>The idea behind these programming contests is that we want you to learn while competing. Also we believe that it is alright to refer to tutorials, books and other materials, learn a concept and then apply the same to solve a problem during a contest. But it is\u00a0<b>not alright to copy other people's solutions or seek other people's help to solve a problem without understanding it.</b> The dividing line may seem to be thin but it can be captured by the spirit of learning. If whatever you are doing is making you learn while you do so, we tend to believe that it is alright. However, all the participants are expected to abide to\u00a0<a href=\"http://discuss.codechef.com/questions/18662/does-codechef-have-any-code-of-conduct\">CodeChef Code Of Conduct</a>.</p> <br /> <p>Not just that, as a token of motivation we also give away cash prizes and goodies to the winners of the contest. You can know more about prizes\u00a0<a href=\"http://discuss.codechef.com/questions/51999/how-do-i-win-a-codechef-goodie\">here</a>. However, our sole intention lies in making our users learn new concepts while competing.</p> </div> <p><br /><b class=\"rules-heading\">What\u2019s new in CodeChef?</b></p> <div class=\"rules-body\"> <p>You may now play with our new\u00a0<a href=\"http://blog.codechef.com/2015/02/04/play-more-in-discuss-with-groups-latex/\">groups &amp; LaTex feature</a> on discuss.</p> </div> <p><br /><b class=\"rules-heading\">Rules and Regulations:</b></p> <ul class=\"\"> <li>Please do not discuss strategy, suggestions or tips in the comments during a live contest.
