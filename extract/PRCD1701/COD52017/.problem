One day his friend Manish gave him a problem of string to test his ability. He give him two strings say p and s, s [l, r] denote the substring of s between index l and index r. The frequency of string s in p be the number of times s occurs as a substring in p. A function f (p, s, l, r) is the frequency of the substring s [l, r] in p. Manish gives Rohit a string s and m pairs of integers describing each interval [li, ri]. He have to answer q queries. Each query j consists of some wj of length k and two integers, aj and bj. Manish also gives him an equation and told Rohit to calculate the result of the equation for each query.\n</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\nRohit is somewhat poor in calculation. He asked for your help to solve the problem and prove himself brilliant.\n</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p align=\"justify\">\n<p>The first line contains four space-separated integers describing n (length of string p), m (number of pairs) and q (number of queries), and k (length of each sj), respectively.\n</p>\n<p>The second line contains string p.</p>\n<p>Each line i of the m subsequent lines contains two space-separated integers describing the respective values of li and ri for interval [li, ri].</p>\n<p>Each line j of the q subsequent lines contains three space-separated values describing string sj, integer aj, and integer bj, respectively.</p>\n</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>\nFor each query, print its answer on a new line.\n</p>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>n,m,q,k</b> \u2264 <b>10^5</b></li>\n<li><b>0</b> \u2264 <b>li</b> \u2264 <b>ri</b> < <b>k</b></li>\n<li><b>0</b> \u2264 <b>aj</b> \u2264 <b>bj</b> < <b>m</b></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The total number of characters in all queries will not exceed 105.</p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n8 5 3 3\nabacdaba\n0 2\n1 2\n0 0\n2 2\n1 2\ndab 1 4\nbac 2 3\neeb 1 3\n<b>Output:</b>\n7\n3\n2\n</pre>\n<h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p><b>In the example, we have p=abacdaba. There are m pairs of intervals\nThere are q=3 queries, and the string for each query has length k=3\nThe first query is dab 1 4, meaning we need to calculate the sum of f (p, si, li, ri) for 1\u2264i\u22644:\nf(abacdaba, dab, 1, 2)=2\nf(abacdaba, dab, 0, 0)=1\nf(abacdaba, dab, 2, 2)=2\nf(abacdaba, dab, 1, 2)=2\nNext, we sum the calculated values to get the answer for this query, which is 2+1+2+2=7\n</b></p>",
