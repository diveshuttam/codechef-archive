Related items are ordered and the delivery is being done. As the delivery man was in hurry, he left all the items outside the gate. The head of neodrishti Manish, called Mukesh to take care of moving the items to the event room and started supervising him. For doing the task, Mukesh brought a bag. He puts a bunch of items in the bag and moved it from the gate to the room.\n</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\nAs Manish was supervising, he\u2019s keen to make sure that Mukesh doesn\u2019t slack off. He wants Mukesh to carry at least 50 unit (unit=any measurement) of items in his bag everytime he goes to the gate in order to finish the task soon.\n</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\nAs Mukesh wasn\u2019t really a weight lifting person, he played it smartly as Manish can only check the weight of the top most item and unaware of the weights of rest of the items.\n</p>\n<p>\nThere are N items to be moved, and Mukesh wants to maximize the number of trips he makes to move all of the items to the room in order to carry less weight. What is the maximum number of trips Mukesh can make without getting berated by Manish?\n</p>\n<p>\nNote that Manish is not aware of what items are to be moved, and he is not keeping track of what Mukesh has already moved when he examines each bag of items. He simply assumes that each bagful contains a total weight of at least k * w where k is the number of items in the bag, and w is the weight of the top item.\n</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p align=\"justify\">\nInput begins with an integer T, the number of test cases. For each test case, there is first a line containing the integer N. Then there are N lines, the ith of which contains a single integer, the weight of the ith item, Wi.\n</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>\nFor each test case, print a line containing the maximum number of trips Mukesh can take.\n</p>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>T</b> \u2264 <b>500</b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>N</b> \u2264 <b>100</b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>Wi</b> \u2264 <b>100</b></li>\n</ul>\n<p>On every day, it is guaranteed that the total weight of all of the items is at least 50 unit.\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n2\n4\n30\n30\n1\n1\n3\n20\n20\n20\n<b>Output:</b>\n2\n1\n</pre>\n<h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p><b>In the first case, Mukesh can make two trips by stacking a 30-pound item on top of a 1-pound item, making the bag appear to contain 60 pounds.<br>\nIn the second case, Mukesh needs to put all the items in the bag at once and can only make one trip.</br>\n</b></p>",
