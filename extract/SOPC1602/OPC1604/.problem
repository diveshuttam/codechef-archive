As the number given by Raavan was huge, Ram was unable to calculate at that time , so he was forced to save sita through war which resulted in loss of  huge troop of monkeys and humans. Now you are given a time machine to travel back to that age. can you solve the question posed by Raavan and avoid the war and save many lives including Raavan.</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>one line consisting of a number <b>N</b> .</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>single line denoting your answer to Raavan.</p>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>N</b> \u2264 <b>10000000</b></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n3\n<b>Output:</b>\n4\n</pre><h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p>The coefficients for binomial expansion of <b>(1+x)<sup>3</sup></b> are 1 3 3 1, out of which all are odd ,so answer is 4.</p>\n",
