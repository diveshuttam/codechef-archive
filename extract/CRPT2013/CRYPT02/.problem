But due to the secretiveness of the organization the names are embedded in a matrix of letters so that it can\u2019t be easily understood. After the boss gives this chit to one of his crew members to reveal it to the rest of the mob, he gets arrested and is now in custody with the CIA. So it\u2019s now in the hands of the CIA to figure out the names to carry on their investigation.<br />\nWrite a program to see if the names of the suspects the CIA has provided is in the matrix of letters given by the mob.\n</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The first line of input contains the length (in characters) of the sides of the letter matrix (the matrix of letters will be square). The following x lines will be the letter matrix itself, each line will contain x uppercase letters. A list of words will follow after the matrix.\n</p>\n<p>\nNote:<br />\nEach word will be on a line by itself containing only uppercase letters.<br />\nThe final line of input will contain a single zero character.\n</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>Your program should search each word from the word list in the letter matrix. The search for word is successful  if all the characters in the word can be searched in a sequence (unidirectional) either  horizontal or  diagonal or vertical line from the letter matrix. A word may be found from right to left (``backwards'') in horizontal and diagonal case. In case of successful search your program should print the coordinates of its first and last letter in the letter matrix on a single line, separated by a single space. Each set of coordinates should be 2 integers where the 1st integer denotes the row number and 2nd one points to the column number, both the integers are comma separated, where the index numbering begins from 1.<br />\nIn case the search is unsuccessful the user should print \u201cNot found''. The search will be successful only once.\n</p>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>x</b> \u2264 <b>100</b></li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n5\nZDSSS\nDISKE\nESJJJ\nECEEE\nVVVVV\nDISC\nDISK\nDISP\n0\n\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n1,2 4,2\n2,1 2,4\nNot found\n\n</pre><p>\n<br />\n<br />\n<b>Note : The reference for this problem has been taken from : UVa online Judge </b>\n</p>\n",
