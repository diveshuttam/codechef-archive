He is specially known for his mathematical skills. Today, in Mathematics lecture,<br />\nHe was introduced with the concept of XOR operation. He understood the concept really well and for practice he asked<br />\nprofessor for more problems. His professor gave him a list of Queries. In every query there were two numbers <b>A</b><br />\nand <b>B</b>. Now Raga\u2019s task is to find XOR of all the numbers between <b>A</b> and <b>B</b> (inclusive). He started<br />\ncalculating the XOR according to queries. Soon he got bored of calculation as it was taking too much time, so he want<br />\nyour help to calculate answers as fast as possible.</p>\n<p><b>NOTE:</b> XOR operation is bitwise exclusive OR operation. It is indicated by a caret ( '^' ) in languages like C, C++, C#, JAVA, Perl, Ruby, Python.</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>First Line Contains single integer <b>'Q'</b>.</li>\n<li>Next <b>Q</b> lines contain two space separated integers <b>\u2018A\u2019</b> and <b>\u2018B\u2019</b>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Output the Result of every query in new line.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>Q</b> \u2264 <b>100</b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>A,B</b> \u2264 <b>10<sup>15</sup></b></li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n3\n3 9 \n17 18 \n3 14 \n\n<b>Output:</b>\n2\n3\n12\n</pre><p>\u00a0</p>\n",
