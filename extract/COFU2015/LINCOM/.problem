Today,<br />\nStudent's Welfare Dean announced that at the end of the week there will be a competition among all the clubs and informed<br />\nevery club to send their best players.</p>\n<p>There are <b>N</b> clubs in college, and every club is sending <b>M</b> best players to compete. Competition involves <b>N</b>\u00d7<b>M</b> matrix.<br />\nEvery row represents certain club, where players of same club will be standing/sitting in same row i.e. players of 1<sup>st</sup><br />\nclub in first row, players of 2<sup>nd</sup> club in second row and so on. In every cell there is a player either standing or sitting.<br />\nStanding state of player is denoted as <b>\u20181\u2019</b> and <b>\u20180\u2019</b> otherwise. At start, state of players is random and is known.<br />\nCompetition will contain <b>R</b> rounds, in every round one of the cell in matrix will be chosen and state of the person belonging<br />\nto the cell will be changed i.e. if state is <b>\u20180\u2019</b> then it will be changed to <b>\u20181\u2019</b> and vice versa. At the end of last round the<br />\nclub having maximum players standing will be declared as winner. Student's Welfare Dean is having lot of work this weekend<br />\nalready, so he told you to organize and look over the competition.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>First line of input contains two space separated integers <b>N</b> and <b>M</b>, represents number of rows and number of columns in<br />\na grid. Next <b>N</b> lines contain <b>M</b> characters without space, representing the state of players in each cell. In next line you<br />\nare given with <b>R</b> i.e. number of rounds, Next <b>R</b> lines contain two space separated integers <b>A</b> and <b>B</b> i.e. the coordinates of<br />\nselected cell. <b>A</b> represents row number and <b>B</b> represents column number.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>Output the row number of the winning team.
