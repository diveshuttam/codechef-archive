We are taking steps to make sure that such situations are avoided in the future.</p>\r\n<p><b>00:36 IST</b>: We apologize profusely for the issue in RAINBOW's testdata. We are looking into ways in which we can keep the contest rated as well as fair. We will let you know by tomorrow.</p>\r\n<p><b>00:00 IST</b>: There was an issue with test data of problem RAINBOW, there were some (i, j) such that i != j and c_i, j = 0. It has been corrected. All non-AC submissions have been put to rejudge.</p>\r\n<p><b>23:58 IST</b>: Contest has been extended by 15 minutes.</p>\r\n<p><b>21:58 IST</b>: There were some trailing whitespaces in the testdata of ROBOTG. It has been fixed now. The previous submissions will be re-evaluated after the contest ends. The inconvenience is regretted.</p>",

At CodeChef, we work hard to revive the geek in you by hosting a programming contest at the start of the month and another smaller programming challenge in the middle of the month.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<p><br /> <b class=\"rules-heading\">About CodeChef March Cook-Off:</b></p>\r\n<div class=\"rules-body\">\r\n<p>CodeChef Cook-Off is a two hand half hour coding contest where you can show off your computer programming skills.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<p><br /><b class=\"rules-heading\">Contest Details:</b></p>\r\n<p><b class=\"rules-heading\"> </b><b>Duration: </b><span>2.5 hrs</span></p>\r\n<p><span></span><b>Start Date: </b><span> Sunday, 19th </span>March,<span> 2017 at 21:30 HRS (IST)</span></p>\r\n<p><span></span><b>End Date: </b><span> Monday, 20th </span>March,<span> 2017 at 00:00 HRS (IST)</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Check your timezone </span><a href=\"https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=March+Cook-Off+2017&amp;iso=20170319T2130&amp;p1=44&amp;ah=2&amp;am=30\" target=\"_blank\">here</a><span>.</span></p>\r\n<p><br /> <b class=\"rules-heading\">Eligibility Criteria: Anyone with a knack for Programming :P</b></p>\r\n<div class=\"rules-body\">\r\n<p>Our contests are open to all the programmers across the globe. However, all the participants are expected to abide to <a href=\"https://discuss.codechef.com/questions/18662/does-  codechef-have-any-code-of-conduct\">CodeChef Code Of Conduct</a>.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<p><br /> <b class=\"rules-heading\">What is it for you?</b></p>\r\n<div class=\"rules-body\">\r\n<p>The idea behind these programming contests is that we want you to learn while competing. Also we believe that it is alright to refer to tutorials, books and other materials, learn a concept and then apply the same to solve a problem during a contest. But it is <b>not alright to copy other people's solutions or seek other people's help to solve a problem without understanding it.</b> The dividing line may seem to be thin but it can be captured by the spirit of learning. If whatever you are doing is making you learn while you do so, we tend to believe that it is alright.</p>\r\n<p>Not just that, as a token of motivation we also give away cash prizes and goodies to the winners of the contest. However, our sole intention lies in making our users learn new concepts while competing.</p>\r\n<b class=\"rules-heading\">For Indians:</b> \r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Top 10 from ranklist will get CodeChef laddus<br /><br /></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<b class=\"rules-heading\">For Rest of World:</b> \r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Top 10 from ranklist will get CodeChef laddus<br /><br /></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<div class=\"rules-body\">\r\n<p>With CodeChef laddus, the winners can claim cool CodeChef goodies.
