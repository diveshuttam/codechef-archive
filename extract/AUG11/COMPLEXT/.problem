He came across the maximum spanning tree problem\nin a grid; which he was able to solve in a jiffy for integral values. But, the never-say-die spirit of our chef\npushed him to something more complex.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">\"What could be more complex than replacing the integer edges by complex edges\", he thought.\nHelp our chef to prove his intellectualism, as much as, he has proven his chef-skills.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">You are given a grid of n*n vertices named as a11, a12, .... a1n, a21, a22, ....a2n, a31, a32, .... ann.\nThere are bidirectional edges between adjacent vertices. So a vertex on the top row (say a14) will have an edge to\nits left element (a13), to its right element (a15) and to its bottom element (a24).\nAny vertex cannot have more than 4 neighbors. Vertices on the edges will have 3 neighbors. Vertices on the corners of\nthe grid will have 2 neighbors. Every edge is given as a complex number \"x y\" (without the quotes).\nNow, you are required to find a spanning tree in this grid, such that, <strong>the modulus of the complex sum of\nthe edges in the spanning tree</strong>, is <strong>maximized</strong>.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">The complex sum is defined for (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) as (x1+x2, y1+y2).\nThe modulus of a complex number (x, y) is square-root(x*x + y*y). A spanning tree is defined as a set of edges in\nthe grid such that every vertex has exactly one unique path to any other vertex.</p>\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p align=\"justify\">The first line of input contains the number \"n\" (without the quotes);\nfollowed by 2n lines of 2n-2 integers each.\nEach line will consist of 2n-2 integers denoting n-1 complex numbers.\nEach consecutive pair of integers represents a complex number denoting the edge between neighboring vertices.\nFor example, in the first row, 1st and 2nd integers form the complex number denoting the edge between a11 and a12.\nThe 3rd and 4th numbers form the complex number denoting the edge between a12 and a13 and likewise the (2n-3)th\nand (2n-2)th integers from the complex number denoting the edge between a1(n-1) and a1n.\nFirst n lines of input will denote the horizontal edges (like edges between aij and ai(j+1)).\nNext n lines of input will denote the vertical edges (like edges between aij and a(i+1)j).\nThe 1st and 2nd integer in the (n+1)th line will form the complex number denoting the edge between a11 and a21\nand likewise the (2n-3)th and the (2n-2)th integer in the same line will form the complex number denoting the\nedge between a(n-1)1 and an1.</p>\n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p align=\"justify\">Output (n*n - 1) lines denoting (n*n - 1) edges in the spanning tree you selected, one on each line\n- in any order. An edge should be represented as the pair of vertices it joins.\nSo to represent the edge joining aij and auv you should output \"i j u v\" (each integer separated by a single space,\nwithout the quotes). An invalid output, such as joining non-neighboring vertices or selecting an edge more than once,\nwill be reported as Wrong Answer.\nOutputting too few edges will also be reported as Wrong Answer. Only the first (n*n - 1) lines of the output will be\nused so take care of not printing blank lines! Out of range values of i, j, u and v will also be reported as Wrong\nAnswer. If the edges are not a valid spanning tree (by the definition above), the judge will report Wrong Answer.</p>\n\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<pre>n = 20\n-100 = weight-x, weight-y = 100\n\n</pre>\n\n<h3>Scoring</h3>\n<p align=\"justify\">The Score for any file / input, would be the modulus of the complex sum of the weights of the edges\nthat you select. The overall score for all files / inputs would be the average of the scores for each test\nfile / input. Your objective is to <strong>maximize</strong> your score!</p>\n\n<h3>Sample Input</h3>\n<em><p align=\"justify\">For the sake of space, small value of n is chosen.</p></em>\n<pre>3\n2 -1 -1 2\n1 3 3 -1\n0 0 -3 0\n3 -2 -2 -1\n2 0 4 -3\n0 1 1 2\n\n</pre>\n\n<h3>Sample Output</h3>\n<pre>1 1 2 1\n1 2 2 2\n1 2 1 3\n2 1 2 2\n2 2 2 3\n3 1 3 2\n3 2 2 2\n2 3 3 3\n\n</pre>\n\n<h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p align=\"justify\">There are 12 edges to be considered. They are given as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li>a11 - a12 = (2, -1)</li>\n\t<li>a12 - a13 = (-1, 2)</li>\n\t<li>a21 - a22 = (1, 3)</li>\n\t<li>a22 - a23 = (3, -1)</li>\n\t<li>a31 - a32 = (0, 0)</li>\n\t<li>a32 - a33 = (-3, 0)</li>\n\t<li>a11 - a21 = (3, -2)</li>\n\t<li>a21 - a31 = (-2, -1)</li>\n\t<li>a12 - a22 = (2, 0)</li>\n\t<li>a22 - a32 = (4, -3)</li>\n\t<li>a13 - a23 = (0, 1)</li>\n\t<li>a23 - a33 = (1, 2)</li>\n</ul>\n<p align=\"justify\">This is also the order in which the complex numbers are given in the input. The score of the given\noutput is sqrt((3+2-1+1+3+0+4+1)^2 + (-2+0+2+3-1+0-3+2)^2) = 13.038405. There may of course be better possible score!</p>",
