Geek wants to play with his RC car in this room.<br/><br />\nThe battery of the car is of limited capacity. We say the capacity of the battery is C, when, from an initial tile, a car with full charge<br />\ncan reach a tile with Manhattan distance of atmost C from the initial tile, i.e,<br/><br />\n|X<sub>f </sub>- X<sub>s</sub>| + |Y<sub>f</sub> - Y<sub>s</sub>| &lt;= C<br />\nwhere, <br/> (X<sub>f</sub>, Y<sub>f</sub>) are the co-ordinates of the final tile,<br/><br />\n      (X<sub>s</sub>, Y<sub>s</sub>) are the co-ordinates of the initial tile.<br/><br />\nInitially, the car is placed in a tile T<sub>s</sub> and the battery has no charge. Geek then recharges the battery (he cannot recharge<br />\nthe battery partially) and plays with the car for some time before recharging again. The battery<br />\nmay or may not be exhausted before he decides to recharge it again. After a 'play', the car would have moved from the initial tile to another tile whose Manhattan<br />\ndistance from the initial tile is less than C. He recharges the car keeping it at the final tile of the previous play and starts playing again from that tile.<br/></br/></br/></br/></br/></br/></br/></p>\n<p>Some of the tiles in Geek Room are damaged and Geek will never make his car stop at a damaged tile at the end of a play. The car also won't be placed in a damaged tile initially.(T<sub>s</sub> won't be damaged)<br />\n<br/></br/></p>\n<p>Now, your task is to find the number of ways the car could have moved after R recharges.</p>\n<p><b>Note</b><br/></br/></p>\n<ul>\n<li>After a 'play', the car can stay in the initial tile.</li>\n<li>The number of ways the car could have moved after a play is the number of final tiles possible.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The first line contains the number of test cases T. T cases follow. Each case contains integers N, R and C on the first line. The next N lines contains N characters each. The ith character on the jth line is a '.' if the corresponding tile is a normal tile, 'D' if the tile is damaged, or 'S' if it is the initial tile T<sub>s</sub>. .</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>For each case, output the number of ways the car could have moved after R recharges. Output each answer modulo 1000000007.\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<p><b>1</b> &lt;= <b>T</b> &lt;= <b>10</b> <br/><br />\n<b>1</b> &lt;=<b> C</b> &lt;= <b>N</b> &lt;= <b>250</b> <br/><br />\n<b>1</b> &lt;= <b>R</b> &lt;= <b>200</b> \u00a0</br/></br/></p>\n<p><br/></br/></p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n3  \n4 1 1  \n....  \n.SD.  \n....  \n....  \n3 2 1  \n...  \n...  \n..S  \n4 3 2  \n....  \n...S  \n..D.  \n...D\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n4  \n11  \n340\n</pre><p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p>For the first case, the car could move to any of the 4 adjacent tiles, except the tile to the right. It can also remain at its position. Thus there are 4 ways the car could have moved after a recharge</p>\n",
