As he is an ardent coder, he never gets to go out and leads a sedentary lifestyle. One day he realises he is getting fat and decides to something about it.<br />\nHe decides to go jogging every morning.<br/><br />\nGeek City is a rectangular city with M X N grids. Each grid can be occupied by a building or can be empty. Occupied grids are marked using '#' and empty grids are denoted by '*'.<br />\nThe residents of Geek city can travel through any grid but the Mayor of Geek City has decreed that residents should not jog inside buildings. From a grid, Geek can go left, right, up or down<br />\nif there is a grid in that direction.<br/><br />\nNaturally, Geek Sundaram has to jog along a path of empty grids. The length of a path is the number of grids present in that path. Also, Geek city is constructed such that, while jogging along a path of empty grids, one will not<br />\nrevisit the same grid again without changing his/her direction.<br/><br />\nCan you help Geek find the length of the longest path he can jog along?<br />\n\u00a0</br/></br/></br/></p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The first line of the input contains two integers <b>M</b> and <b>N</b> denoting the number of rows and columns of grids.</li>\n<li>Each of the following M lines have N characters, the characters being either '#' or '*'.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>Output a single line containing the length of the longest path Geek can jog\u00a0along.</p>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>M,N</b> \u2264 <b>500</b></li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n3 4\n#*#*\n#***\n###*\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n5\n</pre><p>\u00a0</p>\n",
