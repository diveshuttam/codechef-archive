    "body": "<p>The Indian archaeologists recently found remains of an ancient architecture. The location where it was found can be modeled as X, Y square grid cells. The archaeologists then determined whether a building existed at a particular cell or not.\n\n<p>After examining all the clues, they concluded that two buildings, with square shaped floor plans, existed at the location from different periods in time. There is also a possibility that their floor plans may overlap as the buildings were from different periods in time.\n\n<p>You need to determine, for each building, the possible location and size (the length of a side of the square of the floor plan).\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>On the first line, there are two integers X (1 \u2264 X \u2264 100) and Y (1 \u2264 Y \u2264 100),  which specify the size of the location. The next X lines contain strings comprising of '.' (dot) or 'x' (lowercase letter). Here '.' indicates that nothing was found in that cell, while 'x' means that a building was present there. \n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>For each of the two buildings, print on a single line the row and the column of its upper left corner and the size of the building. Also please note that the test data will guarantee that a solution always exists, although it may not necessarily be unique.\n\n<h3>Example</h3>\n\n<pre>\n<b>Input:</b>\n4 6\nxx....\nxx.xxx\n...xxx\n...xxx\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n1 1 2\n2 4 3\n\n<b>Input:</b>\n3 3\nxx.\nxxx\n...\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n1 1 2\n2 3 1\n</pre>\n",
