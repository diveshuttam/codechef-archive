If not then let us revise a few concepts first.\n\n</p><p>The sequences can be generally described by polynomials.  For e.g. the sequence 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 can be easily understood as a trivial polynomial. The next number is 6. But even more complex sequences, like 1, 2, 4, 7, 11, can be described by a polynomial, 1/2.n<sup>2</sup>-1/2.n+1 . Note that even if the members of the sequence are integers, polynomial coefficients may be any real numbers.\n\n</p><p>Polynomial is an expression in the following form: \nP(n) = a<sub>k</sub>.n<sup>k</sup>+a<sub>k-1</sub>.n<sup>k-1</sup>+...+a<sub>1</sub>.n+a<sub>0</sub> \n\n</p><p>If a<sub>k</sub> != 0, the number k is called a degree of the polynomial. Note that a constant function of the form P(n) = C is of degree 0, and the zero function P(n) = 0 is of degree -1. \n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n</p><p>There are multiple test cases in the input. The input begins with a single integer which gives the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. First line of each test case contains two integers L and Q separated by a space, 1 \u2264 L &lt; 100, 1 \u2264 Q &lt; 100, (L+Q) \u2264 100. Here L is the length of the given sequence and Q is the amount of numbers you are required to find to complete the sequence.\n</p><p>The second line of each test case contains L integer numbers Z<sub>1</sub>, Z<sub>2</sub>, ..., Z<sub>L</sub> separated by a space. These numbers form the given sequence and it can be described by a polynomial P(n) such that for every x, Z<sub>x</sub> = P(x). Among these polynomials, we can find the polynomial Pmin with the lowest possible degree which is the required polynomial to be used for completing the sequence. \n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n</p><p>For every test case, print Q integer numbers, which are the values completing the sequence according to the polynomial Pmin, separated by a space, i.e. you need to print Pmin(L+1), Pmin(L+2), ... , Pmin(L+Q). \nIt is guaranteed that the results Pmin(L+x) will be non-negative integers. \n\n\n<h3>Example</h3>\n\n<pre>\n<b>Input:</b>\n4\n4 4\n1 2 3 4\n3 4\n1 2 4\n13 2\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2\n1 9\n7\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n5 6 7 8\n7 11 16 22\n14 92\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n\n</pre></p>",
