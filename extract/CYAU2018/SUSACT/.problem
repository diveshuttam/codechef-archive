The Museum has $N$ sections and the sections are connected to each other such that they form a tree. \nAt the beginning all the sections are marked as unsuspicious but you have to check area which are suspicious in the museum.\nYou will be given $Q$ queries and you have to solve them to keep the museum safe. The queries are as follows:\n- 0 $a$: change the section $'a'$ from suspicious to unsuspicious or vice-versa.\n- 1 $a$: Give the minimum distance to a section $b$ from $a$, such that $b$ is suspicious. Note that if $'a'$ itself is suspicious then the answer will always be 0.\n\n###Input:\n\n- The first line contains $N$, the number of sections in the museum. \n- The next $N-1$ lines are of the form $u$ $v$ which means that the section $'u'$ is connected to section $'v'$ and vice-versa.\n- The next line contains $Q$, the number of queries.\n- In the next $Q$ lines are queries of the type $\"0$ $a\"$ or $\u201c1$ $a\u201d$.\n\n###Output:\nFor each query of the type $\u201c1$ $a\u201d$, print one integer representing the minimum distance to the closest suspicious section. If there is no suspicious section in the museum then you should print $\u201c-1\u201d$.\n\n###Constraints \n- $1 \\leq N \\leq 100000$\n- $1 \\leq a, u, v \\leq N$\n- $1 \\leq Q \\leq 100000$\n\n###Sample Input:\n    10\n    7 1\n    10 2\n    7 3\n    10 4\n    2 5\n    7 6\n    5 7\n    2 8\n    10 9\n    5\n    0 5\n    1 4\n    1 2\n    0 5\n    0 1\n###Sample Output:\t\n3        \n1\n\t\n###EXPLANATION:\nThe section 5 is marked as suspicious by the first query, the second query asks for the closest suspicious section to 4 as only section 5 is marked suspicious in the whole museum we output the distance to 5. Similarly, for third query the answer is the distance from section 2 to 5.",
