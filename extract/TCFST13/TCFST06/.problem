For a city, he records temperatures t(1), t(2) \u2026 t(n) for n days where t(i) is the temperature on the i-th day. Divyam\u2019s hypothesis is justified if first the temperature is negative for some non-zero number of days and then positive for non zero number of days.</p>\n<p>In particular the temperature should never be zero. and there must be a positive integer k lying between 1 and (n-1) (both inclusive) for which the temperature values are all negative and from k+1 to n the temperature values are all positive.</p>\n<p>Divyam becomes happy only if his hypothesis is satisfied, and your task is to keep him happy. Thus making you to modify some temperature values to fit the conditions of his hypothesis. Find the minimum number of such values that are required to be modified</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The first line contains a single integer n - representing the number of days for which Divyam runs his hypothesis testing experiment.<br />\nThe second line contains n integers t(1),\u2009t(2),\u2009...,\u2009t(n)  \u2014 which is  sequence of measured temperature values. Numbers ti are separated by single spaces.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>Print a single integer \u2014 the answer to the given task.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<p>2\u2009\u2264\u2009n\u2009\u2264\u200910<sup>5</sup><br />\n|t(i)|\u2009\u2264\u200910<sup>9</sup></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n5\n0 -4 1 1 -3\n<b>Output:</b>\n2\n</pre><p>\u00a0</p>\n",
