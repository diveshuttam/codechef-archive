Lets say each bead is numbered from 1 to n. You are initially given the beads woven into the necklace in the order 1,2 \u2026.n. That is the ith bead lies to the left of the (i-1)th bead.</p>\n<p>Obviously, you are not as creative to choose the best possible relative positioning of the beads so as to make a limited edition collection. So you take the help of your friend who hands you a permutation scheme that would create a world class piece of jewellery. The permutation can be described by b1,b2\u2026..bn which would mean that the b(i)th bead should lie on the left of the b(i-1)th bead.<br />\nNow to reorder the beads, you need to choose which direction to move a particular bead (right or left) and how many positions should it be moved to reach its desired position. Let us define K as the sum total of distance moved by each bead in the process of reaching its destination. You need to minimise K. In the re-ordering process, all the beads are simultaneously isolated from the necklace.</p>\n<p>Necklace cannot be flipped.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>First line contains one integer n. <br />\nThe second line consists n integers b1, b2, b3, b4 .... bn from a permutation of set {1,2......n} describing the desired order of the beads.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>Output should consists of only one integer k.</p>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<p>1 \u2264 n \u2264 50000</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n4\n4 2 3 1\n<b>Output:</b>\n2\n\n<b>Input:</b>\n4\n4 1 2 3\n<b>Output:</b>\n0\n</pre><p>\u00a0</p>\n",
