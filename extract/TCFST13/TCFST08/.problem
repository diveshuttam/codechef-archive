The King decides to experiment the claims of the magician by putting forward an sequence of such objects. A Gold object is represented by a + and an iron object is represented by a - </p>\n<p>The condition of play put forward by the king is as follows: </p>\n<p>1. If the first object of the sequence is Gold then the last object must change its type (gold should change to iron and vice versa) <br />\n2. The leftmost object in the sequence is removed, and is added into the sequence from the right side after undergoing transformation(gold should change to iron and vice versa). </p>\n<p>After applying these two protocols on the sequence, the King counts up by 1. The King wants to know, the state of his objects after a given number of counts. At count 0, sequence is in its original state</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>First line will consist of an integer h which denotes the no. of experiments conducted by King.<br />\nNext line consists of m and n where m represents the length of the sequence and  n represents the no. of queries asked by the king.<br />\nNext line consists a string of length m composed of '+' and '-' where '+' represents the gold and '-' represents the iron. This sequence will be the initial state (count 0).<br />\nThen, there will be n lines with an integer n(i), representing the count no. at which king wants to know the state of the sequence.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>For each experiment one line containing \"Experiment #j\" , being j the j<sup>th</sup> experiment magician is conducting.<br />\nThen, n strings in each new line, representing the sequence at that time.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<p>1 \u2264 h \u2264 15<br />\n1 \u2264 m \u2264 14<br />\n1 \u2264 n \u22641000<br />\n0 \u2264 n(i) \u2264 10<sup>9</sup></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n1\n4 6\n+--+\n0\n2\n3\n5\n7\n10\n<b>Output:</b>\nExperiment #1:\n+--+\n---+\n--++\n++++\n+-+-\n+---\n</pre><p>\u00a0</p>\n",
