The pieces of rods that are left over are thrown away. Help Jimmy to make the cuts such that he can maximize the amount of money he earns. \n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>1st line will contain number of test cases\n<p>1st line of each test case will contain three integers N, M, C  where N=Number of rods initially, M= Market price of rods per unit length, C = cost incurred for each cut\n<p>2nd line of each test case will contain N integers separated by spaces, which are the lengths of each rod. \n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>Output the maximum amount of money Jimmy can make\n\n<h3>Example</h3>\n\n<pre>\n<b>Input:</b>\n2\n5 1 2\n100 200 100 300 100\n5 2 1000\n100 200 50 100 100\n\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n794\n600\n\n</pre>\n",
