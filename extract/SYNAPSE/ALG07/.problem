And he decided to allocate points to each on basis of his condintion and his neighbours. If the condition of the house is good then it was stated 1 else 0. Thus if both neighbours were in good condition and his condition was also good then he got 3 points, else it was given 2 (if 2 out of the three are good) or 1 based on the condition.\nRaj found out the list of points, and he wants to know the condition of his house. He assumes that the first house of the colony is in good condition.\nGive the condition of the house, given the point list.\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>1st No of test cases\n<p>1st line of each test case is string of points\n<p>2nd house number of raj\n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>0/1/NONE(if assumption about house1 doesnt match the point string).\n\n<h3>Example</h3>\n\n<pre>\n<b>Input:</b>\n1\n22111\n4\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n0\n</pre>\n",
