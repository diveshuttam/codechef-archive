He has <b>N</b> containers numbered from <b>1</b> to <b>N</b>.Everyday, he used to select\ntwo indices <b>[l,r]</b> and adds 1 chocolate to each box starting from <b>l</b> to <b>r</b> (both inclusive).He repeats \nthe same activity for <b>M</b> days.</p>\n\n<p>After <b>M</b> days, he asked his friend Nakshatra <b>Q</b> queries.\nEach query can be described as: How many containers have atleast <b>K</b> chocolates.<br>\nHelp Nakshatra to answer these queries.</p>\n\n<h3>Input Format:</h3>\n<p>First line contains an integer <b>N</b> that denotes the number of containers.<br>\nSecond line contains an integer <b>M</b> denoting the number of days.<br>\nEach of the next <b>M</b> lines consists of two space separated integers <b>l</b> and <b>r</b>.<br>\nFollowed by an integer <b>Q</b> denoting the number of queries.<br>\nEach of next <b>Q</b> lines contain a single integer <b>K</b>.</p>\n\n<h3>Output Format:</h3>\n<p>For each query, print the result in new line.</p>\n\n<h3>Constraints:</h3>\n<pre>\n1 <= N <= 100000\n1 <= M <= 1000\n1 <= l <= r <= N\n1 <= Q <= 100000\n1 <= K <= N\n</pre>\n<h3>Example:</h3>\n<h3>Input:</h3>\n<pre>\n7\n4\n1 3\n2 5\n1 2\n5 6\n4\n1\n7\n4\n2\n</pre>\n<h3>Output:</h3>\n<pre>\n6\n0\n0\n4\n</pre>\n\n<h3>Explanation:</h3>\n<p>Initially, as shown in the sample test case, we have 7 containers, so let's have an array of 7 integers initialized to 0 \n(consider 1-based indexing).</p>\n<pre>\narr = [0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\nAfter Day 1, arr becomes:\narr = [1,1,1,0,0,0,0]\nAfter Day 2, arr becomes:\narr = [1,2,2,1,1,0,0]\nAfter Day 3, arr becomes:\narr = [2,3,2,1,1,0,0]\nAfter Day 4, arr becomes:\narr = [2,3,2,1,2,1,0]\n</pre><br>\n<p>Now, Krish asked 4 queries from his friend:<br>\nQuery 1: How many containers have atleast 1 chocolate?<br>\nAns 1: Containers 1,2,3,4,5 and 6 have atleast 1 chocolates in them. Hence, the output is 6.\n</p>\n<p>\nQuery 2: How many containers  have atleast 7 chocolates?<br>\nAns 2: We can see that there is no container which contains atleast 7 chocolates. Hence, the output is 0.\n</p>\n<p>\nQuery 3: Similar to Query 2.<br>\n</p>\n<p>\nQuery 4: How many containers have atleast 2 chocolates?<br>\nAns 4: Containers 1,2,3 and 5 have atleast 2 chocolates in them. Hence, the output is 4.\n</p>",
