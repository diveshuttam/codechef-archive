Each shop has an initial set of items. But the shopkeepers frequently change their set of items.<br>\nChef is a wholesaler in the market and every day he visits a range[L,R] of shops to fulfill the demand of the shopkeepers. A shopkeeper will replace the existing set of items and will purchase the new set of items if he gets the\nwhole new set of items.\n<br>\nChef is updated with the status of the market. He has all the information about the changes in the market.<br>\nNow chef is asking you the Q queries by providing you the following information,\n<br>\n      Type 1: Replace the set of items of shop(X) with new set of items of size(K).\n<br>\n      Type 2: Chef is only interested in knowing the number of shops where he can sell his set of items.\n<br>\nFor example, suppose there are 3 shopkeepers in the market having {2,7,3},{3,5,9} and {3,4,6,8} as initial stock respectivily. Now chef wants to sell the set {4,10,6,15} from shop(1) to shop(3). But shop(3) is already having {4,6} present in their stock. So there are only 2 shopkeepers (1 and 2) who will buy the set as they are having nothing in common with the chef's set. \n</p>\n\n\n<p>\nNOTE : All indexing are 1 based.\n \n</p>\n<h3>\nINPUT :\n\n</h3><p>\nFirst line contains two space seperated integers N (number of shops in the market) and Q (number of queries to ask). \n<Abr>\nNext N lines contain K+1 space separated integers, first integer denotes K (size of set),next K integers denote the items of the set (initial stock of ith shop).\n<br>\nThe following Q lines describe queries. Each of these lines begin with an integer T denoting the type of the current query if T=1, followed by a integer X(shop number) ,follwed by K+1 space separated integers , first integer denotes K(size of set), next K integers denote the new items of the set(new set for Shop X).<br>\nIf T=2, followed by three integers L , R (denoting the range) and K(size of set), followed by K space sepereted integers\ndenoting the items of the set (chef is willing to sell).\n</p>\n<h3>\nOUTPUT :\n</h3>\n<p>\nFor each Q of type 2 print the number of shops in range [L,R] where chef can sell his product in a new line.\n </p>\n\n<h3>\nCONSTRAINTS :\n</h3><p>\n1<=N<=100000\n1<=Each items<=1000\n1<=Q<=10000\n1<=X<=N\n1<=K<=10\n</p>\n<h3>\n\nSUBTASKS :</h3>\n<p>\nSubtask #1(100 points)\n<br>\nOriginal constraints\n</p>\n\n<h3>\nExample</h3>\n<h3>\nInput :\n</h3>\n<pre>\n4 3\n2 4 5 \n4 1 4 6 8\n2 1 6\n3 1 4 6\n2 1 3 3 1 9 10\n1 3 3 2 3 6\n2 1 4 2 1 9 \n</pre>\n\n\n\n\n<h3>\nOutput :\n</h3><pre>\n1\n2\n</pre>\n<h3>\nExplanation :</h3>\n<p>\nInitial stock of the shops are {4,5} , {1,4,6,8} , {1,6} and {1,4,6}.<br>\nFor first query of type 2, chef will visit shop(1) to shop(3) and try to sell the set {1,9,10} but he can sell his set to shop(1) only as it is having nothing in common with {1,9,10} and hence the answer is 1.<br>\nFor second query of type 1 the new stock of the shops will be {4,5} , {1,4,6,8} , {2,3,6} and {1,4,6}.<br>\nFor third query of type 2 chef will visit shop(1) to shop(4) and try to sell the set {1,9}. Now he can sell his set to shop(1) and to shop(3) as they are having nothing in common and hence the answer is 2. </p>\n",
