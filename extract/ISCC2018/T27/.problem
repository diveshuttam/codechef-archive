He is also very good at Problem Solving Skills. <br>\nHe challenged his classmates to solve a problem based on concepts of geometry. He has given a sequence which consists of <b>N</b> positive integers. He asked to find the number of  possible solutions  by selecting values of  <b>g, f, c, r </b> from the given sequence which satisfies the following equation of finding radius of a circle having centre at (-g,-f). </p>\n<br>\n<pre>\nr=\u221a(g^2+f^2  -c)\n</pre>\n<br>\n<h3>Input Format:</h3>\n<p>The first line of the input contains an integer <b>T</b> denoting the number of test cases. The description of <b>T</b> test cases follows.<br>\nThe first line of each test case contains an integer <b>N</b> which denotes the size of sequence. <br>\nThe second line of each test case contains <b>N</b> space-separated integers denoting the elements of sequence. </p>\n<h3>Output Format:</h3>\n<p>For each test case on new line, print the number of solutions that satisfy the equation of finding radius of a circle as given above.</p>\n<h3>Constraints:</h3>\n<pre>\n1 <= T <= 5\n1 <= N <= 1000\n1 <= a[i] <= 1000000000 , for each valid i\n</pre>\n<h3>Example:</h3>\n<h3>Input:</h3>\n<pre>\n1\n4\n1 2 3 4\n</pre>\n<h3>Output:</h3>\n<pre>\n15\n</pre>\n",
