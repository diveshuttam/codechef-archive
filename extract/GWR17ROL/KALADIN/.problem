More specifically, the probability of a ball being taken out of the bag is equal to it's volume divided by the sum of volumes of all the balls in the bag at that point.</p>\n\n<p>You are bored and decide to play a game. It has <b>N</b> Rounds. In the i-th Round, you want to find the ball numbered i. To do so, you take out balls one by one, <b>without replacement</b>, till you take out the ball numbered i. Then the Round ends, and you place all the balls back into the bag and proceed with the next Round.</p>\n\n<p>You need to find, for each Round, what is the expected number of balls you would need to remove.</p>\n\n<p>Please note that during a single Round, you do not replace any balls you remove. However, every Round starts from scratch with all the balls put in.</p>\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The first line of each input contains a single integer <b>N</b>, the number of balls in the bag.</li>\n<li>The second line contains <b>N</b> integers, the i<sup>th</sup> integer representing the volume of the i<sup>th</sup> ball.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>Print <b>N</b> space separated values on a single line where the i<sup>th</sup> value is the expected number of balls you remove in Round i. Your answer will be considered correct if the absolute error is less than or equal to 10<sup>-6</sup> for each ball.</p>\n\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>1 \u2264 <b>N</b> \u2264 10<sup>3</sup></li>\n<li>1 \u2264 ball volumes \u2264 10<sup>9</sup></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n2\n3 5\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n1.625000 1.375000\n</pre>\n\n<h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p>Finding expected number of balls removed in Round 1: The probability of extracting the first ball in the first try is 3/8. Therefore, we will either extract 1 ball with probability 3/8 or two balls with probability 5/8. Expected number of balls extracted therefore is 3/8 + 2 * (5/8) = 1.625.</p> \n\n<p>Similarly for the second ball, 5/8 + 2 * (3/8) = 1.375</p>",
