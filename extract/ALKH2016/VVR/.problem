After getting graduated, they met again at one of the casino in the city and were challenged by the dealer to play a game.<br /><br /><br />\nThey were given two strings each of length <b>N</b>, where both the strings consist of characters <b>'a'</b>, <b>'b'</b> and empty slots (those marked with <b>'x'</b>) . Moreover, they were also provided count of four pairs of the characters <b>(a,b)</b> namely <b>\"aa\"</b>, <b>\"ab\"</b>, <b>\"ba\"</b> and <b>\"bb\"</b> by the casino dealer.<br /><br /><br />\nNow, Vasya and Vanya have to show their team-spirit by filling all the empty slots using any of the four pairs of characters provided they do not exhaust given pair of characters. They have to make the first string look exactly the same like the given second string in order to win the challenge. They are allowed to carry out the following kind of operation any number of times unless it is not feasible.<br />\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\nPick any two consecutive empty slots in any string and fill them with any of the pair whose count has not exceeded the given threshold.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>\nYou have to tell if it is even possible to win the game for them by applying above operations. Print <b>\"Yes\"</b> if you think they can win, otherwise <b>\"No\"</b> (without quotes).\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Note:</b>  </p>\n<ul>\n<li> Empty slots always exist in pairs i.e one next to another. </li>\n<li> They can end the game at any moment if they wish to.</li>\n<li> The two strings are said to be look alike or same if and only if none of the characters present in them is an empty slot and their corresponding characters are equal. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<ul>\n<li> First line of the input will contain integer <b>T</b> denoting the number of test cases.</li>\n<li> Each test consists of two strings in two separate lines as described in the problem statement.</li>\n<li>Third line contains four integers denoting the count of <b>\u201caa\u201d</b>, <b>\u201cab\u201d</b>,<b>\u201dba\u201d</b> and <b>\u201cbb\u201d</b> respectively.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>For each test-case, output <b>\u201cYes\u201d</b> or <b>\u201cNo\u201d</b> depending on whether they can win together as a team or not in a separate line.\n</p>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>T</b> \u2264 <b>10</b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>N</b> \u2264 <b>20</b></li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n2\naaxxbbaa\nxxxxxxxx\n3 3 3 3\naabb\nbbxx\n3 3 3 3\n<br />\n<b>Output:</b>\nYes\nNo\n</pre><p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Explanation </h3>\n<p><b> Example 1: </b> We can see there are multiple ways to fill the empty slots. One of the ways is to fill only empty slots in first string with <b>\"ab\"</b> and in the second string we can fill slots from left to right as follows <b>\"aa\", \"ab\", \"bb\"and \"aa\"</b>. We would not exhaust the number of each kind provided to us.<br /><br />\n<b>Example 2: </b> There is no way we can make two strings equal.<br /></p>\n",
