She only likes an array if all its neighbouring elements are different (e.g. she likes the array <b>[2,4,2,5,3,2,4]</b>, but not [1,2,3,3,4]).</p>\n\n<p>She now has asked Laddu to please her but with some restrictions.</p>\n\n<p>Laddu can reverse any contiguous subarray of his array any number of times. For example, if he has the array <b>[2,4,2,5,3,2,4]</b> and reverses the subarray from 2nd to 5th element, he will obtain the array <b>[2,3,5,2,4,2,4].</b></p>\n\n<p>Laddu wants to please his girlfriend and for that, he needs to know the minimum number of reversals necessary to transform the array into an array she likes - if it is possible.</p>.\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n\n<p>The first line of the input will contain an integer <b>N</b>. The second line will contain <b>N</b> space-separated integers - the elements of <b>A</b>.</p>\n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n\n<p>If it is impossible to transform Mochu's array into an array she likes, print \"<b>-1</b>\" (without the quotes). Otherwise, print one number - the minimum number of reversals necessary.</p>\n\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li><b>1</b> <= <b>N<sub>i</sub></b> <= <b>1,00,000</b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> <= <b>A<sub>i</sub></b> <= <b>1,00,000</b></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n7\n1 3 2 2 4 4 4\n</pre>\n<pre><b>Output:</b>\n2</pre>\n\n\n<h3>Details</h3>\n\n<p>First, Laddu reverses the subarray from the 3rd to the 6th element and gets the array [1,3,4,4,2,2,4]. Next, he reverses the elements from 4th to 5th and gets the array [1,3,4,2,4,2,4], which Mochu likes. There's no way to create an array which Mochu likes using only one reversal.</p>",
