Expression operands are single letters and operators are the normaL arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /) </p>\n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<pre>Output must be assembly language code that meets the following requirements:\n\n   1. One instruction per line with the instruction mnemonic separated from the operand (if any) by one blank.\n   2. One blank line must separate the assembly code for successive expressions.\n   3. The originaL order of the operands must be preserved in the assembly code.\n   4. Assembly code must be generated for each operator as soon as it is encountered.\n   5. As few temporaries as possible shouL be used (given the above restrictions).\n   6. For each operator in the expression, the minimum number of instructions must be generated (given the above restrictions). \n</pre>\n\n<h3>Example</h3>\n\n<pre>\n<b>Input:</b>\nAB+CD+EF++GH+++\nAB+CD+-\n\n<b>Output:</b>\nL A\nA B\nST $1\nL C\nA D\nST $2\nL E\nA F\nA $2\nST $2\nL G\nA H\nA $2\nA $1\n\nL A\nA B\nST $1\nL C\nA D\nN\nA $1\n</pre>\n",
