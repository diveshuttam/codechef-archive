Examining the locking mechanism, he immediately realized he came across a set of puzzles in FreakoMatix-Axis'10 to reward those who are skilled in the mathematical arts and punish those who are not.<br>\nThere were six dials of the digits 0 through 9 in the puzzle accompanied by a message : \"You will be given two positive integers lesser than or equal to a billion. You need to tell the final 6 digits of raising the first to the power of the second\".<br><br>\nPranay was overstruck with grief. With such huge numbers, the multiplications could take ages, but he had no more than a few seconds to give the right answer.\n</p>\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>Input will consist of multiple lines, each containing two integers A and B (1 <= A, B <= 1000000000), separated by a space. A line containing two zeros signals the end of input and should not be processed.</p>\n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>For each line of input, print out the correct dial settings, i.e. the final six digits of A^B.</p>\n\n<h3>Example</h3>\n\n<pre>\n<b>Input:</b>\n421 1988\n628 496\n0 0\n\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n362161\n493696\n\n</pre>\n",
