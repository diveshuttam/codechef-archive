    "body": "<p>Chef has N Assistant in his restaurant. These Assistant are numbered from 1 to N.Everyday some of the assistant (from number x to y ) comes for work and get some feedback points (positive or negative) by guests.He either adds or subtracts a constant from the feedback-points. He performs M such operations for M days. Each operation is of the form: x y z where each of them is an integer. Chef has to add/subtract z to feedback-points of assistant_number from x to y (both inclusive). After doing this, Chef want to find the maximum feed-back points. Your task is to help Chef in finding the best performance by calculating maximum feedback-points.</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>First line of input contains a single integer T, the number of test cases.<br />\nEach test case starts with a line containing two space separated integers N, number of assistants and M.Then follow M lines. Each of these lines is of the form x y z. Each separated by a single space.</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>For each test case output a single line containing the maximum feedback-point after All modifications.</p>\n<h3>Constraints:</h3>\n<p>1 \u2264 T \u2264 20<br />\n1 \u2264 M \u2264 1000<br />\n1 \u2264 N \u2264 1000000<br />\n1 \u2264 x \u2264 y \u2264 N<br />\n-100000 \u2264 z \u2264 100000</p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre>\n<b>Input:</b>\n1\n10 2\n3 6 -4\n5 9 1\n\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n9\n\n</pre><p><b>Explanation:</b> </p>\n<p>Initially the feedback-points are as follows: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. First operation decreases the feedback of assistant Number 3,4,5 and 6 by 4. Now, the feed-back points looks like: 0 0 -4 -4 -4 -4 0 0 0 0. The second operation increases the numbers of Assistant number 5 to 9 by 1. The feed-back points will now be 0 0 -4 -4 -3 -3 1 1 1 0. Thus, the maximum feedback-points is 1.</p>\n",
