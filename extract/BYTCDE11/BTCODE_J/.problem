He wants to make an impressive and colourful pattern in the courtyard. Importing exotic tiles has become very difficult after the Mumbai terror attacks, and therefore Vikas has only 4 kinds of tiles to choose from:\n<pre>\nA      B      C       D\n==    ==    ==    ==\nXX    X     X      X\nXX    X     XX\n\n</pre>\n<p>Any rotation of above tiles is also permitted.\n\n<p>Each tile is available in 'k' different colors, and there's an infinite supply of all tiles. The courtyard has dimensions 2 * 'n'. Vikas wants to tile the courtyard in such a way that no two adjacent tiles have the same color. Two tiles are considered adjacent if they share a common side. Two tilings are considered different if:\n<p>1) The arrangement of tiles is different.\n<br/>2) There is atleast 1 position (1*1 square) which has different colors in the two arrangements.\n\n<p>Can you help Vikas find the number of different ways in which he can tile the courtyard, subject to the above conditions?\n\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>\nThe first line of input contains a single integer 't', denoting the number of test cases.\n<br/>Each of the next 't' lines contains 2 space separated integers 'n' and 'k'.\n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>For each test case output one integer, denoting the number of different ways in which the courtyard can be tiled.\n<p>Two tiles are considered adjacent if they share an edge. Two tiles which just share a common point are not considered adjacent.\n\n\n<h3>Example</h3>\n\n<pre>\n<b>Input:</b>\n2\n1 1\n1 2\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n1\n4\n\n<b>Constraints:</b>\nt <= 1000\n1 <= n <= 10^9\n1 <= k <= 1000\n\n</pre>\n<b>Explanation:</b>\n<p>Test case 1: There is only 1 way to tile the courtyard, by using a 2*1 tile.\n<br/>Test case 2: Let '1' and '2' be the available colors. The grid can be tiled in 4 ways - 1) place one 2*1 tile of color '1', 2) place one 2*1 tile of color '2', 3) Place two 1*1 tiles (color '1' above and color '2' below), 4) Place two 1*1 tiles (color '2' above and color '1' below)",
