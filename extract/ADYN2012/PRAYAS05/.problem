He puts a number of beakers in a row numbered from <b>1</b> to <b>N</b>. He places 1 shrimp in the first beaker. Then he adds the number of shrimps in this beaker to the next two beakers. Formally, he adds the number of shrimps in beaker <b>i</b> to beaker <b>i+1</b> and <b>i+2</b> without removing any from <b>i</b>. This action is performed for beakers upto <b>N-1</b> such that his <b>N</b> beakers are filled.<br/>\nExperiments can be performed on a beaker <b>j</b> of capacity <b>Sj</b>, if and only if there exists another beaker <b>k, (2 < k < j)</b> of capacity <b>Sk</b> such that <b>Sj = n*Sk</b>, where <b>n</b> is any positive integer.<br/>\n\nThe capacity of each beaker is the maximum number of shrimps it can contain which in turn equals the number of shrimps Mr. Vicky had added earlier.<br/>   \nGiven a number <b>B</b> representing the number of beakers numbered <b>1,2,.. upto B</b>, find the number of beakers <b>A1</b> that are ready for experiments.<br/><br/>\n\nNow there is one more query that comes to Mr. Vicky's mind.\nMr. Vicky has 4 species of shrimps- <b>Calman, Haworth, Dana</b> and <b>Smith</b>. These have a unique way of expanding their species. Each species follow a transformation pattern with each species transforming into 1 or more species after every 1 second. This pattern is static and does not change with time. \n<b>At the beginning (t=0) Mr. Vicky starts with a Calman.</b> The number of different species of shrimps that Mr. Vicky obtains for the next 5 seconds as a result of the transformation of each species is as under.<br/>\nAt <b>t=1 sec</b>, he has 1 Haworth,<br/>\nAt <b>t=2 sec</b>, 1 Smith and 1 Dana,<br/>\nAt <b>t=3 sec</b>, 1 Calman, 2 Haworth and 2 Smith, <br/>\nAt <b>t=4 sec</b>, 3 Haworth, 4 Smith and 2 Dana, <br/>\nAt <b>t=5 sec</b>, 2 Calman, 6 Haworth, 9 Smith and 3 Dana and so on.. <br/>\n\nGiven a time <b>T</b> you have to tell Vicky the number of Calman(<b>A2</b>), number of Haworth(<b>A3</b>) number of Smith(<b>A4</b>) and number of Dana(<b>A5</b>) in the tank.\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The input begins with the number of test cases <b>C</b>. Then <b>C</b> cases follow each of a single line, containing two integers <b>B</b> and <b>T</b>, the beakers numbered <b>1 to B</b>, and <b>T</b> the time(in sec) elapsed after the start of the experiment.  \n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>Print a total of <b>C</b> lines, a single line for each test case containing 5 space separated integers <b>A1, A2, A3, A4</b> and <b>A5</b>.\nAs these numbers can be quite large print Ai modulo 1000000000000007(10^15+7). i=1, 2, 3, 4, 5\n\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<pre>\n1 <= C <= 100000\n0 <= B <= 201200\n0 <= T <= 201200\n</pre>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n\n<pre>\n<b>Input:</b>\n3\n1 1\n2 2\n3 3\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n0 0 1 0 0\n0 0 0 1 1\n0 1 2 2 0\n\n<b>Explanation:</b>\nConsidering the 3rd case, Clearly the three beakers have 1, 1 and 2 shrimps with no pair of (j, k) such<br/> that Sj = n*Sk. Hence beakers ready for experiment is 0. Also after 3 seconds, Vicky has <br/>1 Calmon, 2 Haworth and 2 Smith as given in the problem statements itself. \n</pre>\n",
