Vickyland is a strange state where a city can be connected either by roads to one or more cities(including itself) or can be completely isolated from other cities. While examining the map of Vickyland a very strange and interesting idea came to his mind. He defines 2 cities <b>A</b> and <b>B</b> to form an exclusive pair of cities if and only if for every other vertex <b>C</b>, either <b>A</b> and <b>B</b> both are connected to <b>C</b> or none of them are connected to <b>C</b>. By connected Vicky means that two cities a and b are connected if there exist a sequence of roads from a to b.  Now Vicky hopes to determine the number of pairs of exclusive cities in Vickyland. Help him calculate the number of such pairs mod <b>10^9 + 7</b>.\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The first line consists of the number of test cases <b>T</b>, followed by a blank line followed by <b>T</b> test cases. Each test case is separated from the previous one by a blank line.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space separated integers, <b>n</b> &ndash; the number of cities in Vickyland and <b>m</b> &ndash; the number of roads in Vickyland. Next follows <b>m</b> lines, the <b>i</b>th of these lines containing two space separated integers <b>xi</b> and <b>yi</b>, specifying that the <b>i</b>th road connects <b>xi</b> to <b>yi</b>. The cities are numbered from <b>0</b> to <b>(n &ndash; 1)</b>.\nIt is guaranteed that each unordered pair of cities <b>(xi, yi)</b> occurs no more than once.\n\n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>For each test case print the single integer - the number of unordered pairs of cities that are exclusive mod 10^9 + 7, on a separate line.\n\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<pre>\nT <= 10\n1 <= n <= 500\n0 <= m <= n(n-1)/2\n</pre>\n\n<h3>Example</h3>\n\n<pre>\n<b>Input:</b>\n2\n\n3  0\n\n4 1\n1 3\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n3\n2\n\n</pre>\n<b>Explanation:</b>\n<p>For the second test case, the pairs of cities that are exclusive are (1,3) and (0,2). So a total of 2 pairs.",
