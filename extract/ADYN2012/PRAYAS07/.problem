The people of Byteland are very inquisitive about number sequences and Vicky is pondering over a sequence which they called as an X-Sequence .This sequence is described as follows:</br>\n\nThe sequence is made of integers: <b>a1, a2, a3, a4...aN</b>  where ,</br>\n1) <b>|ak &minus; a(k+1)| = X</b></br>\n2)  <b>a1 = 0</b> </br>\n3)  <b>S = a1 + a2 + a3 + .... + aN</b></br>\n\nHere , <b>X</b> and <b>N</b> are positive integers, and <b>S</b> is the sum. Now, Vicky wants to investigate this X-Sequence, so he would be asking you queries which you have to answer. </br>\n\nThe queries can be of two forms:</br>\nType <b>1</b>: <b>0 S N</b> which asks you to calculate the number of X-Sequences with Sum = <b>S</b> and number of elements as <b>N</b>. (Two X-Sequences are considered to be different if and only if they have different X and  1 <= X <= 10^8 )</br>\nType <b>2: 1 S N</b> which asks you to output the X-sequence, with Sum = <b>S</b> and number of elements as <b>N</b> ,with minimum <b>X</b>.</br>\n\nHelp Vicky answer the two kinds of queries correctly.\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The first line of input consists of number of queries <b>Q</b> after which <b>Q</b> lines follow with each query on a line. There can be two types of queries as mentioned above.\n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>The output should contain <b>Q</b> lines, one for each query.<br/>\nFor Type 1 query, print the query being answered followed by number of distinct X-Sequences possible for 1 <= X <= 10^8, as described above, all in the same line.<br/>\nFor Type 2 query, print the query being answered followed by the sequence as space separated integers. It is guaranteed that there will be at least one sequence for the same. In case there are multiple sequences possible print any one of them.\n\n\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<pre>\nQ <= 5000\n1 <= X <= 10^8\nFor Type 1 query,  &minus;(10^8)  <=  S  <=  10^8, 1 <= N <=  10^6\nFor Type 2 query,  &minus;(10^8)  <=  S  <= 10^8, 1 <= N <= 10^4\n</pre>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n\n<pre>\n<b>Input:</b>\n3\n0 8 3\n1 4 4\n0 0 1\n<b>Output:</b>\n0 8 3 1\n1 4 4 0 1 2 1\n0 0 1 100000000\n</pre>\n",
