It's about how we lived.\"</b></p>\n\n<p>The tyranny against the family of <b>Seg-El</b> has led to a lot of turmoil. Seg-El needs to defeat the tyrants in order to save Krypton. <b>Lyta Zod</b> has agreed to help him as well despite their differences. </p>\n<p>The trap created by the tyrants is in the form of a <b>square grid</b> of size <b>N</b>. Each step on this grid has some posionous value associated with it. A <b>step</b> for this grid is defined as follows- </p>\n<p> If a person is at point <b>(A,B)</b> in the grid, then in one step he/she can move to <b>(C,D)</b> - an another point if and only if </p>\n<p><b>1 \u2264 max( | A - C | , | B - D | ) \u2264 X</b></p> \n<p>where X is some positive integer.</p>\n<p> The step will not inflict any posion only when <b>1 \u2264 X \u2264 2</b>. </p>\n<p>Lyta Zod surmises that the trap can be neutralised only if they take exactly <b>Y</b> steps. </p> \n<p>There are <b>Z</b> crucial start points. </p> \n<p>She can only help Seg-El if she gets to know the <b>number of unique poisonless combinations for each of these <b>Z</b> points with these <b>Y</b> steps such that after each step, the person stays inside the grid only i.e doesn't cross the boundary of the trap grid.</b> </p>\n<p> Two combinations are said to be different if they have at least one step which is different. </p>\n<p>Help Seg-El in finding out the number of such valid combinations for each query. As the answer can be very large, print it modulo <b>10<sup>9</sup>+7</b> </p>\n<p> </p> \n\n<p> </p>\n\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p> First line contains the dimension of square matrix - <b>N</b></p>\n<p> Second line contains an integer <b>Y</b> denoting the number of steps to be taken.</p>\n<p> Third line contains an integer <b>Z</b> denoting the number of points for which the answer has to be obtained.\n<p><b>Z</b> lines follow. </p> \n<p>Each of the next <b>Z</b> lines has two integers - <b>A</b> and <b>B</b> denoting the starting coordinate. </p>\n<p> </p>\n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>For each of the <b>Z</b> queries, print the required number of ways as described. For each query, answer must be on the separate line.</p>\n<p> </p>\n\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>N</b> \u2264 <b>20</b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>Y</b> \u2264 <b>10<sup>14</sup></b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>Z</b> \u2264 <b>400</b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>A,B</b> \u2264 <b>N</b></li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<p><b>Input:</b></p>\n3<br/>\n2<br/>\n1<br/>\n1 1<br/>\n<p></p>\n\n<p><b>Output:</b></p>\n64<br/>\n<p> </p>\n\n<p><b>Explanation</b></p>\n<p>If the start point is (1,1) , the number of distinct ways to make exactly 2 poisonless steps such that the person stays inside the grid only after each step is 64.</p>",
