These soldiers are skilled in the use of swords, spears and bows. It was decided that they will fight the next battle in a <b>3 * N</b> grid formation.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThese soldiers haven't yet been given their weapons for the upcoming battle. Each soldier can be given a sword, spear or a bow. Each soldier has mastered all those weapons. Assume that an infinite supply of each type of weapon is available. In how many ways can the weapons be distributed such that each soldier gets exactly one weapon and there is no redundancy?\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThere is a redundancy in a distribution if two adjacent soldiers have the same<br />\n\tweapon. Two soldiers are adjacent if they are beside each other or if one is in front of or behind the other in the grid formation.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tTwo ways of distributing the weapons are considered different if there is atleast one soldier who gets different weapons.\n</p>\n<p><h3>Input</h3>\n</p><p>\tThe first line of input contains a single integer <b>T</b> denoting the number of test cases.
