During his first<br />\n\tday, he saw that a lot of (electrical) energy is being wasted in the town. In order to<br />\n\tbring down the energy consumption, he wanted to change the way the street lights worked.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tThe town of Vinci has <b>N * M</b> street lights arranged in an <b>N</b> by <b>M</b><br />\n\tgrid. To save energy, Leonardo decided that no two adjacent street lights should be ON. Also, no two<br />\n\tadjacent street lights can be OFF because that area would become dark.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tYou are given the state of all street lights on the grid. You can do one type of operation:<br />\n\ttoggle the state of any street light. What are the minimum number of operations needed such<br />\n\tthat no two adjacent street lights are ON and no two adjacent street lights are OFF.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tTwo street lights are adjacent if they are in the same row or the same column and they are placed at consecutive positions in that row or column.\n</p>\n<p><h3>Input</h3>\n</p><p>\tThe first line of input contains 2 space-seperated integers <b>N</b> and <b>M</b>.<br />\n\tNext, <b>N</b> lines follow,<br />\n\teach containing a string of length <b>M</b>. Each character in the string is either '0' or '1'.<br />\n\tThe j<sup>th</sup> character in the i<sup>th</sup> line denotes the state of the street light at position <b>(i, j)</b>. '0' denotes ON and '1' denotes OFF.\n</p>\n<p><h3>Output</h3>\n</p><p>\tPrint one integer, the answer to the problem.\n</p>\n<p><h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>1 \u2264 <b>N</b> \u2264 500</li>\n<li>1 \u2264 <b>M</b> \u2264 500</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n<p><h3>Sample test(s)</h3>\n</p><p>\t<b>Input</b><br/></br/></p>\n<pre>\n2 3\n110\n101\n\t</pre><p>\t<b>Output</b><br/></br/></p>\n<pre>\n1\n\t</pre><p>\t<b>Explanation</b><br/><br />\n\tWe can toggle the state of the street light at (0,0) and the resulting grid<br />\n\tsatisfies all the required conditions.\n</br/></p>\n",
