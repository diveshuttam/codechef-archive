He imagined that it belonged to a beautiful girl. He was so determined to see the smile on her face that he did the unthinkable - he climbed the mighty waterfalls. When he reached the top, he met Avantika - the girl behind the mask and fell in love with her. He was shocked to learn that she was a warrior, but he was even more impressed after watching her fighting skills.</p>\n<p>One fine day, Baahubali made a tattoo on Avantika's hand without her knowledge, and she was eventually very impressed. She asked Shiva to make more tattoos for her, and he sure doesn't want to disappoint her.</p>\n<p>Initially, Baahubali has <b>N</b> bottles of paint, where each bottle is filled with paint of some color. More specifically, bottle <b>i</b> contains paint of color <b>A<sub>i</sub></b>, and two different bottles may contain paint of the same color. Baahubali uses 2 values <b>L</b> and <b>R</b>.</p>\n<p>He has a secret formula which is the following: He chooses all the unique paints from bottles in the range <b>[L, R]</b> (both inclusive). He then arranges the paints in increasing order of their color (<b>A<sub>i</sub></b>). Assume that there are <b>K</b> unique paints in the range <b>[L, R]</b>, and after arranging them in increasing order of their color value, he gets <b>B<sub>1</sub>, B<sub>2</sub>, ..., B<sub>K</sub></b>. He now mixes all of them by taking exactly <b>i</b> units of paint <b>B<sub>i</sub></b> and summing them up to get a new colored paint. More specifically, he takes <b>sum(i * B<sub>i</sub>)</b> to get a new colored paint.</p>\n<p>Avantika asked him to make <b>M</b> tattoos for her. Your task is to help Baahubali find the value of the new color he gets using the above method, given the <b>L<sub>i</sub></b> and <b>R<sub>i</sub></b> values for each of the M tattoos.</p>\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The first line of input consists of a single integer <b>T</b> denoting the number of test cases. The description of <b>T</b> test cases follow. The first line of each test case consists of a single integer <b>N</b>, denoting the number of bottles of paint that Baahubali has. The second line of each test case consists of <b>N</b> space separated integers <b>A<sub>1</sub>, A<sub>2, ..., A<sub>N</sub></sub></b> , where <b>A<sub>i</sub></b> denotes the color of the paint in the <b>i<sup>th</sup></b> bottle. The next line of each test case consists of a single integer <b>M</b>, denoting the number of tattoos that Baahubali has to make. Each of the following <b>M</b> lines contain 2 space separated integers, where the values on the <b>j<sup>th</sup></b> line denote <b>L<sub>j</sub></b> and <b>R<sub>j</sub></b> for the <b>j<sup>th</sup></b> tattoo.</p>\n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>For each tattoo, output the value of the color that Baahubali creates using the formula mentioned in the statement above.</p>\n\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>T</b> \u2264 <b>20</b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>N</b> \u2264 <b>10<sup>4</sup></b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>M</b> \u2264 <b>10<sup>4</sup></b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>A<sub>i</sub></b> \u2264 <b>10<sup>9</sup></b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>L<sub>i</sub></b> \u2264 <b>R<sub>i</sub></b> \u2264 <b>N</b></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n1\n5\n1 2 3 2 1\n5\n1 1\n1 2\n2 4\n1 4\n1 5\n<b>Output:</b>\n1\n5\n8\n14\n14\n</pre>\n<h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p>For the first tattoo, <b>L = 1</b> and <b>R = 1</b>, and there is only 1 unique color (= <b>1</b>) in that range. Hence, the answer is <b>1</b>.</p>\n<p>For the second tattoo, there are 2 unique colors <b>[1, 2]</b>, and the new color formed is 1*1 + 2*2 = <b>5</b>.</p>\n<p>For the third tattoo, there are 2 unique colors <b>[2, 3]</b>, and the new color formed is 1*2 + 2*3 = <b>8</b>.</p>\n<p>For the fourth and fifth tattoos, there are 3 unique colors <b>[1, 2, 3]</b>, and the new color formed is 1*1 + 2*2 + 3*3 = <b>14</b>.</p>\n",
