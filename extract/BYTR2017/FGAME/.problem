They happen to stumble upon the <b>FunGames</b> stalls. There is one particular  game on that stall that catches his girlfriend's fancy. Being a curious mind that she is, she thinks that the game is impossible to win at and poses a challenge to Bhavit. She promises Bhavit kisses if he wins the game else she'll break up.</p>\n<p> In the game there are <b>B</b> distinct boxes. Also there are various <b>balls</b> of <b>n</b> different colors named from <b>0,1,2...n-1</b>. At first, Bhavit has to distribute the balls in boxes. Then his girlfriend has to randomly choose a box and then randomly select a ball from that box. If the ball is of color <b> 0 </b>, then she'll win and Bhavit will get kisses. </p>\n<p>\nHelp Bhavit in distributing the balls in boxes in such a way that it maximizes his girlfriend's chance of drawing a ball of color <b>0</b> so that he gets kisses and then, tell the probablity that the ball his girlfriend draws is the ball of color <b>0</b>.\n</p>\n<p><b>Bhavit can put any number of balls of any color in any box</b></p>\n<p><b>If the girlfriend chooses an empty Box, that will mean she didn't find a ball of color '0' in that box</b> </p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>First line contains <b>B</b>, total boxes</p>\n<p>Second line contains <b>n</b>, total colors of balls </p>\n<p> The next line contains <b>n</b> space seperated integers <b>c<sub>i</sub></b> where <b>0 \u2264 i \u2264 n - 1</b> denoting total balls of color <b>i</b>.\n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>The only line of output should contain the probablity of drawing ball of color<b> 0</b> as mentioned in problem description</p>\n<p>Your output will be considered correct if it's absolute error is < <b>10<sup>-6</sup></p>\n\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<p></p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>B </b> \u2264 <b> 10<sup>5</sup> </b></li>\n<li>.<b>1</b> \u2264 <b>n </b> \u2264 10<sup>5</sup> </b> </li>\n<li>.<b>1</b> \u2264 <b> c<sub>i</sub> </b> \u2264 10<sup>4</sup> </b> </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n2\n2\n1 1\n<b>Output:</b>\n0.500000\n</pre>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n",
