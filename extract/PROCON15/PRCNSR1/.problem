The game was simple. There were to be <b>T</b> turns.<br />In each turn, all the players would be given a target number <b>N</b> and <b>K</b> tickets numbered from 1 to K. In each turn, they would first have to return a subset of tickets such that the numbers on the tickets sum to N. The number of tickets left unused will be added to their score. Every turn starts with a fresh set of tickets (Thus at the start of every turn, the player has all the tickets numbered from 1 to K). If there is no such subset, then the score for that turn will be -1.<br />Now the stall-owner tells them that there is an entry fee, but if their total score is more than a certain value, then he will let them enter for free. Pajama suspects that the stall-owner is trying to trick them and wants to know the maximum score possible for each round. Help him! </p>\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The first line of input contains an integer <b>T</b> denoting the number of turns. <br />The descriptions of the turns follow. <br />Each turn is described in one line by two space separated integers <b>N</b> and <b>K</b> \n</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>For each turn, output the maximum possible score. <br />The output for each test case should consist of a single integer denoting the maximum score possible for that round or -1 as mentioned in the problem statement. \n</p>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li> T \u2264 10<sup>5</sup> </li>\n<li> 1 \u2264 N \u2264 10<sup>12</sup> </li>\n<li> 1 \u2264 K \u2264 10<sup>5</sup> </li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n2\n4 3\n7 3\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n1\n-1\n</pre>\n<h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p>In the first turn, Pajama has to return tickets numbered 1 and 3. He is left with 1 ticket. In the next turn, there is no subset of tickets which sums to 7.</p>\n",
