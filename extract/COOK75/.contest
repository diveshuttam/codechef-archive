But it is <b>not alright to copy other people's solutions or seek other people's help to solve a problem without understanding it.</b> The dividing line may seem to be thin but it can be captured by the spirit of learning. If whatever you are doing is making you learn while you do so, we tend to believe that it is alright.</p> <br /> <p>Not just that, as a token of motivation we also give away cash prizes and goodies to the</p> <p>Not just that, as a token of motivation we also give away cash prizes and goodies to the winners of the contest.
