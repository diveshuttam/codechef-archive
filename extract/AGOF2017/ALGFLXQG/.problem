You are standing at the origin now u have to choose a direction to throw a ball. The ball will hit the ground at a distance L from the origin and again continue to fly in the same direction and now it will hit the ground at the distance 2L from the origin and so on.(it will continue to fly in the same direction and hitting the plane after each L units)\n<br><br>\nThere are N circles marked on the plane. If a ball hits inside the circle(including its circumference) then you will get one point. You will get a point each if a ball hits multiple circles at once and also when ball hits the same circle multiple times. You have to throw the ball in such a direction so that you will get maximum number of points.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The first line of the input contains T the number of test cases.\nSecond line contains two space seperated integers N and L. Next N lines contains the circle's description.\nThe i'th line contains three space seperated integers xi , yi , ri.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>Print a single integer - the maximum number of points you can get.</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<p>1 <= T <= 20</p>\n<p>1 <= N <= 1000</p>\n<p>5 <= L <= 10</p>\n<p>-1000 <= xi,yi <= 1000</p>\n<p>1 <= ri <= 50</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n2\n1 6\n3 4 2\n2 5\n5 10 3\n6 7 4\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n1\n2\n</pre>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p><b>Example case 1.</b>Self-Explanatory.</p>",
