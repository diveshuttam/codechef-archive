Each of the machine produces some fixed output units for some fixed input units.\nFor instance say machine 1 produce 3 output units for 2 every input units, machine 2 produce 4 output units afor every 3 input units and machine 3 produce 6 units of output for every 4 input units.\nHe is given an order from a company where the company wants a MINIMUM output of &ldquo;Y&rdquo; units for some input of MAXIMUM &ldquo;X&rdquo; units. He has to supply his 3 machines keeping in mind the order made by the company. Help him determine the number of 3 machines so that the total number of machines are minimum. However if more than one solutions exist there would be a priority sequence so that the machine i with higher priority must have more instances.\n<br>If no case is possible to satisfy the company's input-output demand, you should clearly mention &ldquo;No Case&rdquo;.\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>First line of input will be number of test cases.For each case, input the description of all the three machines followed by the priorities for the three machines say-1 2 3 ( priority of machine 1 > priority of machine 2 > priority of machine 3 and hence\nmachine 1 will have more instances than machine 2 or machine 3 in case of more than one answers ) and the total input and output units and give the output before going to the next test case.\n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>Number of all the three machines should be displayed separately for each of the test cases.\n\n<h3>Example</h3>\n\n<pre><b>Input:\n4\n2    3\n3    4\n4    6\n1    2    3\n7    7\n2    3\n3    4\n4    6\n2    1    3\n7    7\n2    3\n3    4\n4    6\n2    3    1\n7    7\n2    3\n3    4\n4    6\n1    2    3\n1    50</b>\n\n<b>Output:\n1    1    0\n0    2    0\n0    2    0\nNo Case</b>\n</pre>\n<br><b>Explanation:</b> \nFirst line is the no of test cases = 3. The next 3 lines describe the 3 types of machines ie the number of output units for number of input units. The line 1 2 3 tells the priority sequence: machine 1> machine 2> machine 3. 7 7 is input output information. 1 1 0 is the resultant output. In the second test case machine description is same but priority is 2 1 3: machine 2>machine1 >machine 3. 7 7 is input output information. 0 2 0 is resultant output. In the third test case machine description is again same but priority is 2 3 1: machine 2 > machine 3 > machine 1. The output will be 0 2 0 again. For the fourth case we expect an output of 50 on the input of 1 unit which is not possible using any combination of the machines described. \n",
