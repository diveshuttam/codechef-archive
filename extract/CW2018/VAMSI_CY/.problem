The city needs to be reconstructed. Justice League appoints Vamsi as their head planner because of his skills and work. Vamsi has found an interesting way to reconstruct the city. As only a few people have left he has decided to make one big city from various small cities so that essential needs can be provided in that city and space left can be optimized for harvesting. He is doing this by shifting people from one city to another and making it one city.He further merges two cities until there is one city left.The cost of merging two cities is equal to the sum of population of two cities.He can merge at max two cities at a time.Can you find out the minimum cost of this process?\n</p>\n<p>\nAs the total cost may become very large, output answer moduled by 10^9+7</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The First line of Input conatins number of test cases</p>\n<p></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The first line of each test case contains an integer <b>N</b> denoting the number of citites. </li>\n<li>Second line of each test contains population(K) of N SPACE SEPERATED cities</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>Output a single line containg the total cost of the reconstruction</p>\n\n\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>T</b> \u2264 <b>10^6</b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>N</b> \u2264 <b>10^5</b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>K</b> \u2264 <b>10^6</b></li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n2\n3\n1 2 3\n2\n2 4\n<b>Output:</b>\n9\n6\n</pre>\n",
