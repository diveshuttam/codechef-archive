Now there are N settlements in a village , and every settlement has 8 houses. Every house is represented as a binary number. Two houses (a,b) or (b,a) [order does not matter] are connected if their binary representation differs by a bit.</p>\n<p>Cost of destroying the village is total cost of all edges. Cost of each edge is initially 0 .But as usual a hero Nicks comes along to save his village , what he does is manipulates the cost array. He takes a random X (such that 0&lt;=X&lt;=7 ) for every settlement (of 8 houses). Then he multiplies the paths of houses excluding {X(mod8),X+1(mod8),X+2(mod8),X+3(mod8)} with \u201c-1\u201d for every settlement.</p>\n<p>Montu can destroy the village only if his compression power P , is greater than or equal to the (modified) cost of the village.</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>First Line contains test case T. Each Test case contains 3 lines. First line of each test case contains N (no. of settlements) , second line contains N integers separated by a single space x1 , x1 \u2026. xn. Third line contains Power P.</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>Output answer to each testcase in a new line. YES if Montu can destroy the village and NO if he cannot.\n</p>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b>N</b> \u2264 <b>40000 (is a power of 2)</b></li>\n<li><b>0</b> \u2264 <b>X</b> \u2264 <b>7</b></li>\n<li><b>-1000</b> \u2264 <b>P</b> \u2264 <b>1000</b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>T</b> \u2264 <b>1000</b></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n2\n1\n4\n10\n2\n4 3\n-7\n\n<b>Output:</b>\nYES\nNO\n<p>1) In first test case you have 8 houses, the houses that are connected are <br />(0,1) , (0,2) , (0,4) , (1,3) , (1,5) , (2,3) , (2,6) , (3,7) , (4,5) , (4,6) , (5,7) , (6,7) And X=4 => cost of edge <br />(0,1),(0,2),(0,4),(1,3),(1,5),(2,3),(2,6),(3,7) are multiplied by -1.Thus the cost of village is -4 .<br /> Hence Montu can destroy the village.\n2) In case two the cost comes out to be -6 thus he CANNOT destroy the village.</p>\n\n</pre>",
