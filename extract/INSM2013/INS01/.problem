But people of Byteland are health conscious, they don't want to eat two pizzas and hence they always go in such groups (so that they have to pay half price for a pizza).</p>\n<p>If a group is not formed they will go on next wednesday. Two people will go together if and only if they are friends (Yes, friendship is transitive). As you know, byteland consists of many special people, one of them is our own Punk-it, who loves Pecorino cheese burst Pizza a lot.
