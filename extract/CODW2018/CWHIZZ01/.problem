The singers decided to sing a song even though the audio system of the hall is damaged. A song lover can enjoy the song if he is inside of any of the singer's  range  (the radius upto which the voice can be reached)\n</p><p>The problem is some of  the singers have forgotten the lyrics. But a singer can recollect the  lyrics if he/she is inside of any of the singers' range. Finally, all the song lovers should enjoy the song that is sung by the singers.\n\u00a0</p>\n\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The first line of the input contains an integer <b>T</b> denoting the number of test cases. The First line of each test case contains two spaced integers : <b>S and N</b>. <b>S</b> denotes the number of singers and <b>N </b>denotes the number of the song lovers.\nEach of the next <b>S</b> lines contains </b>(x,y)</b> denoting the coordinates of the singers in the 2D plane . Next <b>N</b> lines denote the coordinates of the song lovers.\n\n</p>\n<p>Tips:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The range of every singer is the same.\n</li>\n<li>Atleast one of the singers knows the lyrics. \n</li>\n<li>No two people can be in the same location.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>Print T lines, each line denoting the minimum range required by the singers  rounded off to 6 decimal digits.\n.</p>\n\n\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>1 \u2264 <b>T</b> \u2264 5</li>\n<li>1 <= <b>N,M</b> <=  20</li>\n<li>0 <= <b>x,y</b> <= 100 </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n1\n1 2\n1 1\n0 0\n0 2\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n1.414214\n</pre>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p><b>The singer needs to cover two song lovers. So, the range of the singer will be the minimum of distance between (1,1) and (0,0) and the distance between (1,1) and (0,2). </b> </p>",
