That is, the chef randomly chooses one arrangement out of all assignments satisfying the two conditions.\nThe chef wonders, after a certain number of ringings of the bell,\nwhat the expected number of guests who will be back in their original chairs\nwill be.</p>\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>Input will begin with an integer T, the number of test cases.\nEach test case consists of a single line with 2 integers N and R,\nthe number of chairs and number of ringings, respectively.</p>\n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>For each test case, output on a single line the expected number\nof guests who will be back in their original seats after exactly R\nringings, rounded to 5 decimal places.</p>\n\n<h3>Sample Input</h3>\n<pre>4\n2 1\n2 2\n4 2\n5 3\n</pre>\n\n<h3>Sample Output</h3>\n<pre>0.00000\n2.00000\n1.33333\n1.36364\n</pre>\n\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\nT\u2264300<br />\n2\u2264N\u226450<br />\n1\u2264R\u22641000000<br />",
