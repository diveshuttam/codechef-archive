He dreamt about the infinite Cartesian coordinates with <strong>N</strong> kings placed on it at different integer positions (<strong>x</strong>,<strong>y</strong>) initially. But suddenly his alarm rings and bang, it was time to gear up for the all important upcoming match India vs Australia.<br />\n<p/>However on his way to stadium in the bus he ponders over the minimum total number of moves required to bring any <strong>K</strong> kings to the same position. A position can hold multiple kings at the same time. A single move consists of choosing exactly one king and moving it one unit in either of the four directions, up, down, right or left.<br />\nHelp him find a solution quickly to this problem so that he can concentrate on scoring runs, which he is best at. </p/></p/></p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The first line of the input contains an integer <b>T</b> denoting the number of test cases.

The total number of moves can be minimized if we bring the 1st king and the 3rd king to position (3,5). The 1st king will need 2 moves to reach there and the 3rd king will need 0 moves. Therefore, the answer will be 2+0 = <b>2</b>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n",
