    "body": "<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>A Maths teacher has a class of N students. Infuriate with their lack of discipline, he decides to cancel class if less than K students are present when class starts.\n\nGiven the arrival time of each student, determine if the class is canceled or not..</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The first line of input contains T , the number of test cases.\n\nEach test case consists of two lines. The first line has two space-separated integers, N (students in the class) and K (the cancelation threshold). The second line contains N space-separated integers (a1,a2,a3,....,an) describing the arrival times for each student.\n\nNote: Non-positive arrival times indicate the student arrived early or on time; positive arrival times  indicate the student arrived  late.</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>For each test case, print the word YES if the class is canceled or NO if it is not.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n2\n4 3\n-1 -3 4 2\n4 2\n0 -1 2 1\n\n<b>Output:</b>\nYES\nNO\n</pre>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p><b>Example case 1.</b> For the first test case,K=3 . The professor wants at least 3 students in attendance, but only 2 have arrived on time (-3 and -1). Thus, the class is canceled.\n\nFor the second test case,K=2 . The professor wants at least 2 students in attendance, and there are 2 who have arrived on time (0 and -1). Therefore, the class is not canceled.\n</p>",
