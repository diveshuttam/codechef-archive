On his birthday his friends wanted to give him\nthe best feast he ever had. So they took him to restaurant and ordered N number of dishes.</p> \n<p>Initially his hunger is 0,\nas the time passes the hunger of Aakash increases by K ounces per second(i.e he can eat K ounces after 1 sec, K more after another\nsecond and so on). Now at end of certain time T[i] seconds, dish weighing D[i] ounces arrives.Aakash can reject this dish if he wants, but Aakash can only eat this dish if his hunger is greater than or equal to the D[i] and D[i] will be subtracted from his current hunger.\nElse he has to reject the dish, the dish is thrown away and nothing is reduced from his current hunger.\n</p>\n<p>\nAakash wants to eat maximum number of dishes\nso he asks for your help. Help him figure out the maximum number of dishes he can eat.<br>\nNote : Aakash will eat the dish completely, so no partial eating and whole weight of the dish is reduced for his hunger.\n</p>\n<b>Input :</b><br>\n<p>\nFirst Line consists of a single integer N - number of dishes.\nNext N lines consists of T[i] and D[i] - arrival time of a dish and it weight.<br>\nAll T[i] are distinct.<br>\nLast line consists of a single integer K - the rate at which Aakash's hunger increases.<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Output:</b>\n<br>\nOutput a single integer , telling the maximum number of dishes Aakash can eat.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Constraints :</b>\n<br>\n<b>Subtask 1 :</b><br>\n\t1 <= N <= 1000<br>\n\t1 <= T[i] , D[i] <= 1000 <br>\n\t1 <= K <= 10^7<br>\n\n<b>Subtask 2:</b><br> \n\t1 <= N <= 500000<br>\n\t1 <= T[i] , D[i] <= 10^9<br>\n\t1 <= K <= 10^7<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Sample input 1 : </b>\n</p>\n<p>\n5<br>\n11 2<br>\n2 3<br>\n4 2<br>\n10 7<br>\n12 1<br>\n1<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Sample output 1 :</b>\n<br>\n4<br>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n<b>Explaination :</b><br>\nAakash can eat maximum 4 dishes. Aakash cannot eat the dish arrived at T[i] = 2 with D[i]=3 as his current hunger is 2 while the weight of the dish is 3, \nrest he can eat all 4 dishes afterwards.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Sample input 2 :</b><br>\n3<br>\n2 100<br>\n3 101<br>\n5 200<br>\n12<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Sample output 2:</b><br>\n0<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Explaination :</b><br>\nAakash cannot eat any of the dishes as his hunger is always less than the D[i] at corresponding T[i].<br>\n</p>\n",
