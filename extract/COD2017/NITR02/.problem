Each student in the college reports to a unique senior student, except the student representative (that is Sonic). This hierarchy can be modelled as a tree, rooted at the student representative. Nodes 'v' having parent node 'u' means that 'u' is the senior student to which node 'v' reports. Also node 'v' is a junior to node 'u'.</p>\n<p>In case of any notifications regarding INNOVISION, 2K17, Sonic first notifies his juniors one at a time. The juniors in turn notify their juniors one at a time. This continues until every student in the college has been notified. We can divide this process into times. In one time, a student who has learnt of the notification can notify to one of his juniors. The total time it takes for everyone to get notified depends on the sequence in which a senior calls their juniors. Help Sonic determine the minimum total time needed to notify all the students.</p>\n<p>Note:</p>\n<li>Senior and Junior relationship can be thought of as Parent and Child relationship.</li>\n<li>A Senior can notify to a Junior with whom he/she is directly connected.</li>\n\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<ul>First line contains 'n' denoting the number of students.</ul>\n<ul>'n-1' space separated integers follow. (i)th integer denotes that it is the parent of (i+1)th node.</ul>\n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<ul>The minimum total time required.</ul>\n\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<p>Should contain all the constraints on the input data that you may have. Format it like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>1</b> <= <b> n </b> <= <b>100000</b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> <= <b> parent[i] </b> <= <b>n</b></li>\n</ul>\n<ul><li><b>parent[i] != i</b></li></ul>\n\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n4\n1 2 1\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n2\n</pre>\n\n<h3>Explanation</h3>\n<pre>Explanation:\nThe tree can be considered as:\n1 -> 2\n2 -> 3\n1 -> 4\n\nConsider first situation:-\nFirst time: 1 notifies to 2.\nSecond time: 1 notifies to 4 and 2 notifies to 3.\n\nConsider another situation:-\nFirst time: 1 notifies to 4.\nSecond time: 1 notifies to 2.\nThird time: 2 notifies to 3.\n\nTherefore first situation is better as it takes 2 units of total time.</pre>",
