    "body": "<p>Tom and Hanks play the following game. On a game board having a line of squares labelled from 0,1,2 ... certain number of coins are placed with possibly more than one coin on a single square. In each turn a player can move exactly one coin to any square to the left i.e, if a player wishes to remove a coin from square i, he can then place it in any square which belongs to the set (0,1, ... i-1) . Given the description of the board and also assuming that Tom always makes the first move you have tell who wins the game (Assuming Both play Optimally).\n\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The first line will contain N the number of test cases and then 2N lines follow. For each test case the first line will have S the size of the board and in the next line S integers follow. The i<sup>th</sup> integer gives the the number of coins in the i<sup>th</sup> square. Atleast one of the S integers will be non zero. All the numbers in the input will be less than 25.\n\n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>For each test case output one line containing either \"Tom Wins\" or \"Hanks Wins\".\n\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre>\n<b>Input:</b>\n2\n1\n1\n1\n2\n\n<b>Output:</b>\nTom Wins\nHanks Wins\n</pre>\n",
