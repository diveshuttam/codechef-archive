He gave an interesting idea to students about hiding some information using modular exponentiation. Sookhi being one of the enthusiastic students of the class tried to challenge the Professor by saying that he can break the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_logarithm\">Discrete Logarithm</a> problem easily.<br />\n<br /><br /><br />\nRNC accepted his challenge on one condition that if Sookhi fails, he would not be allowed to sit for the next examination. Professor gave him the parameters to be <i>y</i> = 696969, <i>g</i> = 21309 and <i>p</i> = 999998999999 and asked him to find the smallest <i>x</i> such that <b><i>y=g<sup>x</sup> mod p</i></b>.<br />\n<br /><br /><br />\nSookhi tried to solve the problem but he is facing difficulties. He now realizes that he should not have challenged the Professor that he does often. He promises not to repeat this in future if you help him out this time.</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>Output the smallest <i>x</i> such that <b><i>y=g<sup>x</sup> mod p</i></b> is true.</p>\n<h3>Info about Submission </h3>\n<p>You just have to print the final answer. Rest you have to put the source code/ abstract of your solution inside the comments for plagiarism checking.</p>\n<h3> Sample Submission (c++)</h3>\n<p>#include&lt;iostream><br /><br />\nusing namespace std;<br /><br />\nint main(){<br /><br />\ncout&lt;&lt;\"VALUE OF x\";<br /><br />\n}<br /><br />\n/* Put your source code here inside comments for plagiarism checking */</p>\n\n",
