The last person left would have to be treated by the rest.  The game went like this. From among n of his classmates, numbered 1, 2,...,n, standing in a circle every mth person is going to be disqualified.  Mark is smart enough to choose the position of the last remaining person, thus always getting a treat. Now to make the game more fun he wanted his friends to last longer than the rest of his classmates. In the circle the first p are his good friends and the last p, his other classmates. You have to determine a minimal m such that all his other classmates will be out of the game before the first friend.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The first line contains t, the number of test cases (1&lt;=t&lt;=100). The following t lines have a positive integer p (1&lt;=p&lt;14) </p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>The output file will consist of t lines, each containing the integer m corresponding to p in the input file. </p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n2\n3\n4\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n5\n30\n</pre><p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<br />\n<br />\n<b>Note : This problem has been taken from previously solved problems.  </b>\n</p>\n",
