Their terrace can be thought of as a grid playing field. In order for any of them to win, one of them needs to get a direct hit and they need to be in a direct line of vision of the other person, horizontal, vertical or diagonal. Given a (P*Q) playing field you will have to decide in how many ways can the two of them be positioned to obtain a head-on attack on each other.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>Input file can contain up to 5000 lines of inputs. Each line contains two positive integers which denote the value of P and Q (0&lt; P, Q&lt;10^6) respectively. Input is terminated by a line containing two zeroes. These two zeroes need not be processed.</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p> For each line of input produce one line of output, denoting the number of ways they can be in an attacking position in the (P*Q) playing field. All output values will fit in 64-bit signed integer.\n</p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n2 2\n100 223\n0 0\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n12\n10907100\n\n</pre><p>\n<br />\n<br />\n<b>Note : This problem has been inspired from previously solved questions.</b>\n</p>\n",
