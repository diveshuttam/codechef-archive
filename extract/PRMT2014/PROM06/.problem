Since class 5, they have been in the same section. They usually sat on the last bench so that they could chat all they want during the class. One day, during the ancient martial arts period, Master Kirigi caught them and asked Damian to sit in the first bench.<br />\nDamian, however, was one who did not give up easily. He decided that he can send messages to Carrie by writing each message on a small piece of paper and passing it to the students sitting in the front who finally pass it on to Carrie. Being the intelligent boy he was, he quickly encrypted his messages by an unknown encryption method, to ensure that no one else read it, and passed it backwards to Carrie. Carrie, however, was not as good in cracking encryptions.<br />\nIn her time of need, Carrie asks for your help in cracking the encryption and encrypting any message that she wants to pass to Damian.\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The first line of the input will consist of an integer t (1&lt;=t&lt;=100)<br />\nt lines follow.<br />\nEach line consists of a string S (1&lt;=|S|&lt;=1000), which will consists of only lower case letter, numbers and special symbols. </p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>Output will consist of t lines. Each line will consist of a string E corresponding to the encrypted message.</p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n2\ndie another day.\ni'm batman.\n\n<b>Output:</b>\nv0w s56bzw9 vsg.\n0'4 tsb4s5.\n</pre>",
