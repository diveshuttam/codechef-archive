He was pretty sure that he would solve it and just 5 minutes before contest, his solution got accepted and as always he topped in that contest.\n</p>\n<p>Very next day, he decided to give this question to his coder friend <a href=\"https://www.codechef.com/users/pheonix123\"><span style=\"color:#FF4500;\">Pheonix123</span></a>(even his coding capabilities can\u2019t be measured).Both of them have code flowing in their blood.<a href=\"https://www.codechef.com/users/algorithmist2\"><span style=\"color:#FF4500;\">Algorithmist2</span></a> provided him an array consisting of \u2018n\u2019 integers and asked him to do following operations: </p>\n<p>1. Update the position at \u201cx\u201d of array to \u201cy\u201d ie A[x]=y.\n<br>2. Find if there is any prefix in the array whose sum equals to \u201cS\u201d.If yes, then output \u201cFound\u201d and the last index of prefix, else output \u201cNot Found\u201d.\n<br>As expected, <a href=\"https://www.codechef.com/users/pheonix123\"><span style=\"color:#FF4500;\">Pheonix123</span></a> also did it in about 25 minutes. Now, its challenge for you to do the same.</p>\n\n<p><b>Note:Array is 1-indexed.</b>\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>First line contains two space separated  integers  <b>\u201cN\u201d</b> & <b>\u201cM\u201d</b>, denoting the number of elements in the array and the number of operations or queries.</p>\n<p>Second line consists of <b>\u201cN\u201d</b> space separated integers. </p>\n<p>Next M lines consists of queries of following form :</p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>1 p q:</b> Change the value at position p to q ie  <b>A[p] to q.</b><br>(3 space separated numbers)</li>\n<li><b>2 S:</b> Find if there is any prefix whose sum equals <b>\u201cS\u201d</b>.<br>(2 space separated numbers)</li>\n</ul>\n<p> where <b>1</b> indicates query of type 1, <b>p</b> is index of array and <b>q</b> is value to be updated with.<br>Similarly, <b>2</b> indicates query of type 2 and <b>S</b> is prefix sum which needs to be checked in the array.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>In a single line,for each query of type <b>2</b>, if the prefix exists in the array,then print a string <b>\u201cFound\u201d</b>(without quotes) along with the index <b>i</b> denoting last position of prefix, separated by space, else print <b>\u201cNot Found\u201d</b>(without quotes). </p>\n<p> </p>\n\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>A[i],q</b> \u2264 <b>10^12</b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>N,p</b> \u2264 <b>10^5</b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>M</b> \u2264 <b>10^5</b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>S</b> \u2264 <b>10^17</b></li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<p>\n<b>Input:</b>\n<br>\n<br>4 4\n<br>1 2 3 4\n<br>2 6\n<br>1 4 10\n<br>2 16\n<br>2 5\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Output:</b>\n<br>\n<br>Found 3\n<br>Found 4\n<br>Not Found\n</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3>Explanation:</h3>\n<p>In first query of type 2, we have to check if there is any prefix with sum=6.Yes!!.The first three elements of array sums to 6(1+2+3).So, last index of prefix sum is 3.Prefix sum always means sum of first 'd' elements of array, where d can be any number starting from index 1 to N(inclusive)</p>\n<p>Similarly, check for other queries ;)</p>",
