So he turns to the field developed solely for this purpose, cryptography. Chef invents his own code, where each character is represented by the binary number denoting its position in the alphabet. For example, <b>a</b> becomes <b>1</b>, <b>e</b> becomes <b>101</b>, and <b>z</b> becomes <b>11010</b>. To encode a string, he encodes each character of the string and concatenates the results. For example, <b>code</b> -> <b>11, 1111, 100, 101</b> -> <b>111111100101</b>.</p> \n\n<p>He encodes his message and sends it to his crush, and only after that he realizes that decoding the cipher may produce many valid results. For example, <b>111111100101</b>, which can be decoded to say <b>code</b>, can also be decoded to say <b>gcya</b>, or <b>acacde</b>, or some other word. Chef realizes his mistake but he wants to make sure no harm is done. He does not want any inappropriate word to appear in any such decoded message. Given a word, can you help him find the <b>total number of times it occurs as a substring in all possible decodings</b> of an encoded string?</p>\n\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The first line of the input contains <b>T</b>, the number of test cases.</p>\n<p>The first line of each test case contains the encoded string <b>S</b>.</p>\n<p>The second line of each test case contains <b>W</b>, the word Chef wants to look for.</p>\n<b>Note: Please trim trailing whitespaces</b>\n<p> </p>\n\n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>For each test case output a single line containing the number of times <b>W</b> appears in all valid decoded strings that can be obtained from <b>S</b>. As this number can be very large, print it modulo <b>10<sup>9</sup>+7</b></p>\n\n\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>T</b> \u2264 <b>5</b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>|S|</b> \u2264 <b>4\u00d710<sup>5</sup></b></li>\n<li><b>S</b> is made up of the characters <b>0</b> and <b>1</b>.</li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>|W|</b> \u2264 <b>|S|</b></li>\n<li><b>W</b> is made up of <b>lowercase alphabet</b> only.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n3\n10001001\nh\n100001000100001000100001000\nphph\n10001001100111101111000101110\nchef\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n2\n2\n68\n</pre>\n\n<p> </p>\n<h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p><b>Test case 1</b>: <b>10001001</b> can be decoded to give either <b>hi</b> or <b>hda</b>, and <b>h</b> is present once in both of these.</p>\n<p><b>Test case 2</b>: <b>100001000100001000100001000</b> can be decoded to give <b>phphph</b> only.
