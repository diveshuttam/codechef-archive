There are N cities numbered from 0 to N-1.<br />\nInitially you are at city no. 0 and Treasure you are looking for is at city number N-1.<br />\nEach city is connected to two cities directly except for city number 0 and city number N-1 wich are connected to only one city directly.<br />\n0-->1-->2-->3-->4........-->N-1<br />\nAs the journey from a city to another city is tiring you can pass at maximum d-1 cities without stopping.<br />\nFor eg. if you are at city 0 and d is 3 then you can move from 0 to 3 without stopping at city 1 or city 2.<br />\nIf you stop at any city you have to pay a certain amount of money M[i] to that city which varies from city to city.<br />\nGiven money required to pay for stopping at each cityy our task is to reach city number N-1 from city number 0 by spending minimum amount of money possible.<br />\nRemember You can only start from city 0 if you pay the amount that should be paid to city 0. As you have to reach city N-1, you have to stop there, so you will have to pay the respected amount.\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Input :</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The first line of the input contains an integer <b>T</b> denoting the number of test cases.
