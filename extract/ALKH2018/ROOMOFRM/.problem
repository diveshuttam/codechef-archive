Sometimes it is there, and sometimes it is not, but when it appears, it is always equipped for the seeker's needs.\"</center></i>\n<b><p align=\"right\">- Hermione</p></b>\n<p>\nDuring the tyrannous ruling of Dolores Umbridge, the Army of Dumbledore is formed. But they all need a secret place to practice their spells. Here comes the Room of Requirement to aid!!\nBut to their much surprise they have to solve a problem as well as perform a perfect spell combo of <b>Invoker</b>, who happens to be a legendary hero in <b>DOTA 2</b>(To know the secret for perfect spell combo of Invoker, contact the author *laughs*). As everyone is either a wizard or witch, they ask you to solve the problem which is stated below.</p>\n<p>\nYou are given an undirected graph of <b>N</b> vertices having <b>M</b> edges. Also you are given a list of <b>O</b> operations and <b>Q</b> queries.\n</p>\n<p>Initial connected component of any vertex is its connected component before applying <b>any</b> operation.</p>\n<p>\nIn every operation an existing edge is removed. Hence the graph changes after every operation.</p>\n<p>\nQueries are of two types:\n<ol>\n<p><li><b>u 1</b> - maximize integer <b>X</b> such that after applying exactly the first <b>X</b> operations in the given order, the connected component of vertex <b>u</b> contains atleast <b>one</b> loop.</p>\n<p>If before applying any operation, the connected component of vertex <b>u</b> has no loop, then answer <b>-1</b>.</p>\n</li>\n<p><li><b>u 2 z</b> - minimize integer <b>Y</b> such that after applying exactly the first <b>Y</b> operations in the given order, the <b>initial connected component</b> of vertex <b>u</b> is divided to atleast <b>z disjoint connected components</b>.</p>\n<p>If even after applying all operations, there aren't atleast <b>z</b> disjoint connected components, then answer is <b>O+1</b>.</p> \n</li>\n</ol>\n<p></p>\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The first line of input contains four space separated integers <b>N, M, O and Q</b>.</p>\n<p>\nNext <b>M</b> lines contain two space separated integers <b>x</b> and <b>y</b> denoting an undirected edge between vertices <b>x</b> and <b>y</b>.\n</p>\n<p>\nNext <b>O</b> lines contain two space separated integers <b>a</b> and <b>b</b> denoting an operation, meaning the edge between vertices <b>a</b> and <b>b</b> is to be removed from graph.</p>\n<p>\nNext <b>Q</b> lines contain queries either of first type or second type.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Note : </b> It is guaranteed that in every operation exactly one edge will be removed. Hence, no two operations are same. Also graph doesn't contain multiple edges or self loops and the <b>order</b> of applying operations is strictly from first to last operation.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>\nFor each query output the required number of operations in a separate line. \n</p>\n<p></p>\n\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>1 \u2264 <b>N</b> \u2264 100000</li> \n<li>1 \u2264 <b>M</b> \u2264 min( N*(N - 1)/2 , 200000)</li>\n<li>1 \u2264 <b>O</b> \u2264 <b>M</b></li>\n<li>1 \u2264 <b>Q</b> \u2264 100000</li>\n<li>1 \u2264 <b>u</b> \u2264 <b>N</b></li>\n<li>1 \u2264 <b>z</b> \u2264 10<sup>9</sup></li>\n<li>1 \u2264 <b>a, b, x, y</b> \u2264 <b>N</b>\n</ul>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n6 6 5 5\n1 2\n2 3\n1 3\n3 4\n2 4\n3 5\n1 2\n3 5\n1 3\n2 3\n2 4\n1 1\n1 2 2\n1 2 5\n2 1\n6 1\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n2\n2\n6\n3\n-1\n\n</pre>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p>\nIn first query, after applying 2 operations, connected component of vertex <b>1</b> still has a loop consisting of vertices 2, 3 & 4. But after applying 3rd operation, vertex <b>1</b> gets separated and hence has no loop in its connected component. Hence we can apply maximum 2 operations so that connected component of vertex <b>1</b> contains atleast one loop.</p> \n<p>\nIn second query, after applying two operations, the initial connected component of vertex <b>1</b> which consisted of vertices <b>{1,2,3,4,5}</b> gets divided into two disjoint connected components which are <b>{1,2,3,4}</b> and <b>{5}</b>.",
