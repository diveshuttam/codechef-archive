    "body": "<p>Given an rectangular grid of N rows and M columns, each cell can be labeled black (Yin) or white (Yang). Two cells are neighbors if they share a common unit-length edge segment. The grid is valid if all the black cells form a path, and all the white cells form a path. A path is a set S of cells defined as follows:<br />\nThe cells form a connected piece. From each cell in S, you can reach any other cell in S by moving between neighbors within S. Exactly two cells in S have exactly one neighbor in S each. These are the \"ends\" of the path. Every other cell in S has exactly two neighbors in S.</p>\n<p>Given N and M, compute the number of valid grids. Note that symmetry doesn't matter -- as long as two valid grids differ in one position they are considered different, even if one can be rotated or flipped to the other.<br />\n\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The first line of the input will be a single integer T, the number of test cases. T lines follow, each of which contains two integers separated by a space: \"N M\", as defined above.</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>For each test case, output the number of valid grids of the specified size..</p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n3\n4 4\n4 6\n5 5\n\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n24\n44\n48\n\n</pre><p>\u00a0</p>\n",
