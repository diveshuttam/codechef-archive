One fine day she came up with a game called <b>\"Infinity\"</b>.\nThe game runs infinitely and is played by infinite players (strange huh?).<br>\nThe rules of the game are as follows:<br>\n<ul>\n<li>Of the infinite players playing the game, only <b>2</b> are active at a time. One is <b>\"striker\"</b> and the other one <b>\"unstriker\"</b>.</li>\n<li>They have a <b>dice</b> having <b>8</b> faces with each face having a number from <b>-1 to 6 (-1,0,1,2,...).</b></li>\n<li>Every minute the <b>striker</b> rolls the dice.<br>\n<ul>\n<li>If the number on dice is <b>-1</b> then the <b>striker</b> is said to be <b>\"Knoced Down\"</b> and has to leave the game and new player takes his place and becomes striker.</li>\n<li>If it is something else then this number is added to the <b>\"Total Score\"</b> as well as the score of the player. Also if this number is <b>odd</b> then the <b>unstriker</b> becomes <b>striker</b> and <b>striker</b> becomes <b>unstriker</b>.</li>\n</ul>\n<li>After every <b>x</b> minutes, comes a <b>\"Swap Phase\"</b> when the striker becomes unstriker and the unstriker becomes striker.\n<b>Note:</b> The Swap Phase occurs after the above rules applicable for the dice throw are followed. </b>\n</li>\n</ul>\nYou are given the numbers appeared on dice in first <b>n</b> rolls. Simulate the game and after every striker is Knocked Down and leaves the game print <b>2 integers</b> denoting his score and current Total Score. Finally after the <b>n</b> minutes output the Total Score.\n</p>\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>\nFirst line contains two integer <b>n</b>, denoting the number of minutes of the game whose details are given and <b>x</b>, the time inteval in which the Swap Phase occurs.<br>\nNext <b>n</b> lines contain an integer (Y) each denoting the number appearing on the dice.<br>\n</p>\n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>Whenever a player is Knocked Down and has to leave the game print <b>2 integers</b>, his score and current Total Score at that point respectively.<br> Finally print the Total Score.</p>\n\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b>1</b> <= <b>n</b> <= <b>10<sup>5</sup></b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> <= <b>x</b> <= <b>n</b></li>\n<li><b>-1</b> <= <b>Y</b> <= <b>6</b></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n8 5\n3\n2\n-1\n6\n-1\n2\n-1\n5\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n2 5\n6 11\n5 13\n18\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p><b>Example case 1.</b> <br>\n<b>1:</b> Player 1 is striker and Player 2 is unstriker. Player 1 scores 3. Total score 3. <br>\n<b>2:</b> Player 2 is striker and Player 1 is unstriker. Player 2 scores 2. Total score 5. <br>\n<b>3:</b> Player 2 is striker and Player 1 is unstriker. Player 2 Knoced Down. Player 3 becomes striker. <br>\n<b>4:</b> Player 3 is striker and Player 1 is unstriker. Player 3 scores 6. Total score 11. <br>\n<b>5:</b> Player 3 is striker and Player 1 is unstriker. Player 3 Knocked Down. Player 4 becomes striker. <br>\n<b>Swap Phase</b> Player 1 becomes striker and Player 4 becomes unstriker. <br>\nand so on..\n\n</p>",
