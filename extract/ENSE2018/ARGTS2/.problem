For the purpose they started examining <b>N</b> \nsites within the island numbered <b>1</b> through <b>N</b>. They know that if the food present in each site is less than a particular amount, then all the ants in that region will die.</br>\nBut the Argentine Ants are also smart. The ants started making underground tunnels to connect between different sites to facilite food transfer. Soon, the department came to know about \nthis and started to identify the sites that are connected by tunnels. They need to send the data to their headquarters to analyze and effectively kill the ants in the island.<br/>\nTwo sites are considered connected if they are connected directly or there is a series of tunnels connecting them together.<br/>\nCan you help the federal environment in their mission.\n</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The first line contains an integer <b>T</b> denoting the number of test cases.</li>\n<li>The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers <b>N</b>, denoting the number of sites and <b>M</b>, denoting the number of queries made by the federal \ndepartment.</li>\n<li><b>M</b> lines follow. Each of the <b>M</b> lines contains a query denoted by three space-separated integers.<br/>\nThere are two types of queries:-\n<ul>\n<li><b>1 x y</b> indicating that the department has found a tunnel between site <b>x</b> and site <b>y</b></li>\n<li><b>2 a b</b> which indicates that the headquarter wanted to know if site <b>a</b> and site <b>b</b> are connected</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>For each query of type <b>2 a b</b>, in a new line output \"YES\" without quotes, if site <b>a</b> and site <b>b</b> are connected otherwise output \"NO\" without quotes.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>T</b> \u2264 <b>10</b></li>\n<li><b>2</b> \u2264 <b>N</b> \u2264 <b>10<sup>9</sup></b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>M</b> \u2264 <b>10<sup>5</sup></b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>a, b, x, y</b> \u2264 <b>N</b></li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<h3>Example Input</h3>\n<pre>\n1\n3 4\n1 1 2\n2 1 3\n1 2 3\n2 1 3\n</pre>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<h3>Example Output</h3>\n<pre>\nNO\nYES\n</pre>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<Explanation>\n<b>Example case 1:</b>At first the department finds a tunnel between site 1 and site 2. Now the headquarters wanted to know if site 1 and site 3 are connected and the answer is \"NO\". \nAfter this they find a tunnel between site 2 and 3. Now, when the headquarters wanted to know if site 1 and site 3 are connected, the answer will be \"YES\".\n\n<hr/>",
