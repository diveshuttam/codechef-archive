    "body": "<p> </p>\n<p> Bhrigudov love natural numbers but hates the ones which are prime. So, to pester him, some of his friends gave him few numbers and asked him to represent them as the sum of two composite numbers. Also, to make things more difficult for him, they ask him that the product of the pair should be the least among all the pair products having the same sum. Bhrigudov trying not to get defeated by his friends asked for your help.\n(Composite numbers are whole numbers which are divisible by number(s) other than 1 and itself).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The first line of the input contains an integer <b>T</b> denoting the number of test cases. The description of <b>T</b> test cases follows.\nThe only line of each test case contains an integer <b>N</b> denoting the number which is to be represented as a sum of 2 composite numbers. \n</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>For each test case, output a single line containing two space separated integers <b>X</b> and <b>Y</b> (<b>X</b><=<b>Y</b>) such that X and Y are composite numbers, X+Y = N and for all composite integers A, B (satisfying A+B = N), min(A*B) = X*Y.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>T</b> \u2264 <b>100000</b></li>\n<li><b>12</b> \u2264 <b>N</b> \u2264 <b>10000000</b></li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n1\n15\n<b>Output:</b>\n6 9\n</pre>\n<p> </p>\n<h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p><b>Example case 1.</b> Here X=6, Y=9. Sum X+Y=15. Among all the pairs X,Y (composite numbers) such that X+Y=15, X=6 and Y=9 have the least product.</p>\n",
