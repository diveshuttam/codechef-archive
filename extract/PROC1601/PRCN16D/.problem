    "body": "<p> </p>\n<p>Two friends, Oj and Bhrigudov, play a very simple game. They have 2 bags in front of them - a red coloured and a blue coloured - each containing some marbles. The rules of the game are as follows : Oj starts first. They take alternate turns. In each turn they have to take out any number of marbles from exactly one of the bags. The player whose turn is the last turn of the game, i.e there are no marbles remaining inside both bags after their turn, wins! The first turn of Oj is given in the input. You have to tell the winner of the game assuming both players are equally intelligent and play optimally.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The first line of the input contains an integer <b>T</b> denoting the number of test cases. The description of <b>T</b> test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space separated integers <b>R</b> and <b>B</b> denoting the number of marbles in the red and blue bags respectively.\nThe next line contains a space separated character <b>C</b> and an integer <b>N</b>. <b>C</b> denotes the colour of the bag from which Oj takes out <b>N</b> marbles in the first turn. (Note : C will be either 'R' or 'B', without quotes, denoting Red and Blue respectively. Also, it is guaranteed that the first move will be a valid move.)\n</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>For each test case, output a single line containing \"Oj\" if Oj would win this game or \"Bhrigudov\" if Bhrigudov would win this game.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>T</b> \u2264 <b>100000</b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>R,B,N</b> \u2264 <b>1000000000</b></li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n3\n1 1\nR 1\n2 1\nB 1\n2 1\nR 1\n<b>Output:</b>\nBhrigudov\nBhrigudov\nOj\n</pre>\n<p> </p>\n<h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p><b>Example case 1.</b> After the given first move, there's only 1 ball in the blue bag. Bhrigudov takes out that ball and wins.</p>\n<p><b>Example case 2.</b> After the given first move, there are 2 balls in the red bag. Bhrigudov takes out the 2 balls from the red bag and wins.</p>\n<p><b>Example case 3.</b> After this given first move, there is 1 ball in each red and blue bag. Bhrigudov may choose to take out either of the ball and Oj will take out the other one and win.</p>\n",
