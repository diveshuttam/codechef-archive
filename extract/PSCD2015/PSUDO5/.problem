On his birthday, Chef as always, makes up a game to entertain his friends.<br /><br />\n<br /><br />\nIn the game of Chef, he divides his friends into two groups, 'Thinkers' and 'Guessers'. First group, Thinkers, are asked to think of a positive integer. The integer which they choose can be same. The Chef being the Birthday Boy gives a 'Special number'.<br /></p>\n<p>Now the game is that the second group of friends, i.e. Guessers, need to guess the number of non empty subsets of integers whose product yields out the Chef's 'Special number'.<br /></p>\n<p>Since, there can be a large number of such subsets, Chef asked them to give the value modulo 1,000,000,007.<br />\n<br /><br />\nHelp Chef find the winner of the game.\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The first line should be number of test cases <b>t</b>.<br />\n<br /><br />\nFor the next <b>t</b> times, input will contain the Special Number, <b>S</b>, and the subsequent line should contain an array of positive integers that were thought, separated by a space, <b>Array A</b>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>For every test case, let the number of subsets (non empty) containing integers which has the special number or on multiplication of all of its elements gives that special number,<b>S</b> be <b>N</b>.<br />\n<br /><br />\nYou have to print <b>N modulo 1,000,000,007</b></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<p>Should contain all the constraints on the input data that you may have. Format it like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>t</b> \u2264 <b>100</b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>S</b> \u2264 <b>2,000,000,000</b></li>\n<li>Size of the <b>Array A</b> will be between <b>1</b> and <b>100</b></li>\n<li>Elements of the <b>Array A</b> will be between <b>1</b> and <b>2,000,000,000</b></li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n4\n5\n1 2 3 4\n12\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12\n1\n1 1 1\n2\n2\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n0\n6\n7\n1\n</pre><p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p><b>Example case 1.</b><br />\nThere is no subset possible with 5 occurring in it.\n</p>\n<p><b>Example case 2.</b><br />\nThere are 6 subsets, namely {1,12}, {2,6}, {4,3}, {12}, {1,2,6}, {1,3,4} .\n</p>\n<p><b>Example case 3.</b><br />\nThere are 7 subsets, namely {1}, {1}, {1}, {1,1}, {1,1}, {1,1}, {1,1,1} .\n</p>\n<p><b>Example case 4.</b><br />\nThere is 1 subset possible with 2 occurring in it which is {2}.\n</p>\n",
