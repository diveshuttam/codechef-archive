He has conducted several tests and finally selected N equally brilliant<br />\nstudents.Now he don't know whether to train all the N students or not. Now since Holmes was in a confusion, Watson came up with an idea. He wanted to<br />\ntest the obedience of the students. So during the camp, the students were given some Swiss Chocolates as gifts each time when they passed a level.Now some of them have<br />\nfinished eating all the chocolates, some of them had some remaining. Now to test their team chemistry and IQ skills, Watson told the lads to arrange themselves in such </p>\n<p>a way that,  number of chocolates of the ith kid should be equal to the sum of  <b> (i-1)</b>th kid and <b>(i-2)</b>th kid. Now they have arranged themselves in an order.</p>\n<p>Now Sherlock announced that he will select the students who have formed the line according to this order. But since there can be many such small groups among the<br />\nentire N kids, he will select a sequence of kids such that the length of the sequence is maximized, meanwhile satisfying the above condition\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>First line is an integer <b>T</b> which denotes the total number of test cases. Each of the next T lines contains an integer N which denotes, N students. The next </p>\n<p>line contains N spaced integers.where it denotes the order in which the kids arranged themselves. </p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>Each line contains an integer which denotes the maximum number of students among the N students who have arranged themselves according the rule said by Watson.It is guaranteed that Holmes will select atleast 1 or 2 students</p>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>T \u2264 10</b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>N \u2264 10^5</b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>Each of next N integers \u2264 10^9</b></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Subtasks</h3>\n<p>\n<b>Subtask #1 : (20 points)</b></p>\n<ul>\n<b>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>T</b> \u2264 <b>10</b></li>\n<li>1 \u2264 N\u2264 100</li>\n<li>1 \u2264 Each element\u2264 10^3</li>\n<p></p></b>\n</ul>\n\n<p>\n<b>Subtask 2 : (80 points) </b><br /></p>\n<ul>\n<b>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>T</b> \u2264 <b>10</b></li>\n<li>1 \u2264 N\u2264 100000</li>\n<li>1 \u2264 Each element\u2264 10^9</li>\n<p></p></b>\n</ul>\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n2\n5\n2 3 5 1 2\n3\n1 2 3\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n3\n3\n</pre><p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p><b>Example case 1.</b> Here the first kid has 2 chocolates, second has 3 chocolates, third kid has 5 chocolates, which is the sum of first kid's total chocolates </p>\n<p>and second kid's chocolate. Forth student has only 1 chocolate where he did not follow the rule. So the maximum number of kids who arranged themselves in the order was </p>\n<p>3. That is students at index 1 to index 3.</p>\n",
