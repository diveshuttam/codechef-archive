Special Security forces are chasing him. To catch him as soon as possible they seek the help of CAI.</p>\n<p>\nYou are an agent at Central Agency of Investigation a.k.a CAI, your boss has assigned you a task of tracking a person who has just escaped the prison, with the help of the advanced satellite imaging of the institute.\n </p>\n<p>\nThe satellite sends you the real time coordinates of the prisoner as well as that of the city. You figured out that the city is a straight line divided into <b>N</b> segments. It is also known that for a pair of segment, they either have no common points or all points of one segment belong to the second segment. (Here points are the houses belonging to segment)\n</p>\n<p>\nThe satellite gives you <b>M</b> changing positions of the prisoner. For each position, your task is to report the security forces of the segment of minimum length, to which the prisoner belongs.\n</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The first line consists of an integer <b>N</b>, that is the number of segments The Next <b>N</b> lines consists of integers <b>xi</b> and <b>yi</b> that are the coordinates of the endpoints of the segment. All segments are distinct. The next <b>M</b> lines contains an integer <b>cj</b>, that is the number of changing positions.<b>cj</b>.\n</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>For each position output the number of the corresponding segment on a single line, if the point doesn\u2019t belong to any segment, print <b>\u201c-1\u201d.</b>\n</p>\n<p><b> Note:</b> The segments are ordered from <b>1 to N.</b>\n</p>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>N</b> \u2264 <b>10^5</b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>xi</b> &lt; <b>yi</b> \u2264 <b>10^9 </b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>M</b> \u2264 <b>10^5</b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>cj</b> \u2264 <b>10^9</b></li>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n3\n2 10\n2 3\n5 7\n5\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n-1\n2\n2\n1\n3\n</pre><p><br /></p>\n<p> Problem Setter : Anish Kumar </p>\n</ul>",
