Now a days, many of the colleges are providing better<br />\nservices for hostel students, NITT is also one of them. In NITT, every student who resides in hostel can<br />\naccess Wi-Fi and printing services for free of cost for which  every student is allotted a username and password. Arpit, as a student<br />\nof NITT has also got the same but  is worried because his friends always hack his password and misuse it.<br />\nSo, he wants to secure his password  for which he has N types of encryption techniques and each, say it, M<sup>th</sup> technique<br />\nuses only one key.<br />\nNow, if anyone wishes to encrypt the message using Mth encryption technique, he has to use M<sup>th </sup>number key.</p>\n<p>Arpit also wants to encrypt his password with N encryption techniques, but he has no idea about key for every M<sup>th</sup><br />\ntechnique. He knows only some of the initial keys which are as follows: 1 1 1 1 1 9 17 25 57 113 and so on.....<br />\nNow, help Arpit to find keys for all N encryption techniques.</p>\n<p>Since, the key is a very large number, so, print answer by taking modulo 10<sup>9</sup>+7</p>\n<h3>Input Format :</h3>\n<p>First line contains an integer N, total numbers of encryption techniques.Then, next N lines contain a single integer M which<br />\ndenotes M<sup>th</sup> encryption technique.</p>\n<h3>Output Format:</h3>\n<p>For each N, output one integer( key for M<sup>th</sup> encryption technique).\n</p>\n<h3>Constraints:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b>1&lt;=N&lt;=400</b></li>\n<li><b>1&lt;=M&lt;=10<sup>14</sup></b></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Subtasks:</h3>\n<p><b>Subtasks 1  : 7 points</b> </p>\n<li>1&lt;=N&lt;=10</li>\n<li>1&lt;=M&lt;=100</li>\n\n\n<p><b>Subtasks 2 : 23 points</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li>1&lt;=N&lt;=100</li>\n<li>1&lt;=M&lt;=10<sup>4</sup></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><b>Subtasks 3: 70 points</b> </p>\n<p>Original constraints</p>\n<pre><b>Sample Input</b>\n5\n1\n2\n3\n8\n9\n<b>Sample Output</b>\n1\n1\n1\n25\n57\n </pre>",
