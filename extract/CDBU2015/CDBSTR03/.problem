So, she decided to relax for a little bit and there is no better way to relax than to play with the numbers.<br />\nMonika loves to solve problems of statistics. She opened her favourite problem set archive and there she found a task that she thinks is best suited to her.<br />\nThe problem was to find medians of some numbers. Median is the middle number of a sorted list of numbers.<br />\nSo, in general, if we have M numbers(A1, A2, A3 .... AM), we define the median as element A[(M+1)/2] if M is odd and  (A[M/2] + A[(M+1)/2])/2 otherwise.<br />\nShe solved this problem very quickly and modified the problem to make it a little harder to test her skills further.<br />\nShe has <b>N</b> numbers and she modified it to find <b>N</b> medians. For example, If she has the set {4,7,3,1,9}, 1st median will be 4, 2nd median (4+7)/2, 3rd median 4 and so on.<br />\nSo, <b>i-th</b> median is taken on the subset [A1,A2 ...Ai] for <b>1 &lt;= i &lt;= N</b>.<br />\nBut while doing the modification, she made it so hard that it became very difficult for her to solve. Now, she is seeking for your help to solve this problem. Can you please help her.\n</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The first line contains the number of test cases. Each test cases contains an integer <b>N</b>. next line consists of <b>N</b> integers, the elements of the set.\n</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>\nFor each test case, print <b>N</b> medians, <b>1</b> median in a single line. See example for better clarification.\n</p>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b> 1 </b> \u2264 <b> T </b> \u2264 <b> 10<sup>5</sup> </b></li>\n<li><b> 1 </b> \u2264 <b> N </b> \u2264 <b> 10<sup>5</sup> </b></li>\n<li><b> 1 </b> \u2264 <b> Ai </b> \u2264 <b> 10<sup>5</sup> </b></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n<p>\n1\n5\n4 7 3 1 9\n</p>\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n<p>\n4\n5.5\n4\n3.5\n4\n</p>\n</pre>",
