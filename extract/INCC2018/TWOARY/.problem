Each dish is denoted by a unique number. The length of both the sequences of dishes is same and equal to N.\n\nOur little chef likes the dishes which occur equal number of times in both the sequences between any given indexes L to R. Little chef being too little has many wishes though. Among all the liked dishes she wants to eat dishes which occur odd number of times. \n\nGiven Q queries each containing two integers L and R, can you please help our master chef to find out the count of unique dishes that little chef can eat.\n\n\n###Input:\n\n- First line will contain $N$. \n- Second line will contain $N$ space-separated integers, $A[i]$.\n- Third line will contain $N$ space-separated integers, $B[i]$.\n- Fourth line will contain $Q$, the number of queries. \n\n- Each query contains a single line of input, two integers $L$, $R$. \n\n###Output:\n\nFor each query, print a single line containing one integer \u2014 the answer of the query.\n\n\n###Constraints \n- $1 \\leq N \\leq 100000$\n- $1 \\leq Q \\leq 100000$\n- $1 \\leq A[i], B[i] \\leq 100000$\n- $1 \\leq L\\leq R\\leq N$\n\n###Sample Input:\n    6\n    1 2 1 3 2 1\n    4 1 1 1 2 5\n    5\n    4 6\n    1 3\n    3 3\n    3 6\n    1 6\n\n\n###Sample Output:\n    2\n    0\n    1\n    1\n    1\t\n###EXPLANATION:\nFor query #1:\n    Little chef likes two dishes (1 and 2), both of them occur odd number times in that range. So, she can eat both of them. Hence, the answer is 2.\n\nFor query #2:\n    Little chef likes only one dish (1), but she can not eat it as it doesn't occur odd number times in that range. So, the answer is 0.\n\n",
