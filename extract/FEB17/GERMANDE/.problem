    "body": "<span class=\"solution-visible-txt\">All submissions for this problem are available.</span><p> The country of BitLand is divided into <b>N</b> districts, and these districts are arranged in a circle: <b>1, 2, 3, ..., N</b>, where <b>i</b> and <b>i+1</b> are adjacent for all <b>1 \u2264 i \u2264 N-1</b>, and also <b>1</b> and <b>N</b> are adjacent. It is given that <b>N = o<sub>1</sub> * o<sub>2</sub></b>, where <b>o<sub>1</sub></b> and <b>o<sub>2</sub></b> are odd integers.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThere are only 2 political parties in BitLand: the Zeros and the Ones. There was an election, in which each district chose it's representative who is either a Zero or a One. We know this data. i.e. for each of the <b>N</b> districts, we know whether their representative is a Zero or a One.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe <b>N</b> districts should be partitioned into <b>o<sub>1</sub></b> states, where each state consists of <b>o<sub>2</sub></b> consecutive districts.\n<br \\>\nFor example, if <b>o<sub>1</sub> = 5</b> and <b>o<sub>2</sub>=3</b>, then <b>N=15</b>, and {1,2,3} would be a valid state. {2,3,4}, {13,14,15}, {14,15,1}, {15,1,2} are other examples of valid states. But {3,5,6} is not a valid state, because the districts are not consecutive.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nA state gets a One Governor if, among all the <b>o<sub>2</sub></b> district representatives belonging to it, there are more One district representatives than Zero representatives. And it gets a Governor who is from the Zero party, if the majority of its district representatives are from the Zero party. And because <b>o<sub>2</sub></b> is odd, there will be no ties.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe President of BitLand will be a One if the majority of the <b>o<sub>1</sub></b> state Governors are Ones. Otherwise, the President will be from the Zero party.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut the state boundaries have not been fixed yet. Given just the district-wise data (i.e. whether each district's representative is a Zero or a One), you need to find if there is a way to partition them into states such that the President is a One.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The first line contains one integer, <b>T</b>, which is the number of testcases.\n<li>The first line of each testcase contains two space separated integers, <b>o<sub>1</sub></b> and <b>o<sub>2</sub></b>, which are the number of states, and number of districts in each state, respectively.\n</li>\n<li>The next line of each testcase contains <b>N = o<sub>1</sub> * o<sub>2</sub></b> space separated integers: <b>d<sub>1</sub>, d<sub>2</sub>, .., d<sub>N</sub></b>. If <b>d<sub>i</sub></b> is <b>1</b>, then it signifies that District <b>i</b> has chosen a One representative. If <b>d<sub>i</sub></b> is <b>0</b>, then they have a Zero representative.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Each testcase should be in a new line, and should contain <b>1</b>, if the President can be a One, and <b>0</b> otherwise.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<p>For all subtasks you may assume that: \n<ul>\n<li>\n<b>1 \u2264 T \u2264 100</b>\n</li>\n<li><b>o<sub>1</sub>,o<sub>2</sub></b> will be odd positive integers.</li>\n\n<li><b>1 \u2264</b> Summation of <b>o<sub>1</sub>*o<sub>2</sub></b> over all testcases <b>\u2264 10<sup>6</sup></b></li>\n<li><b>0 \u2264 d<sub>i</sub> \u2264 1</b></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>\n<b>Subtask 1</b>: For 10% of the score,\n<ul>\n<li><b>1 \u2264</b> Summation of <b>o<sub>1</sub>*o<sub>2</sub></b> over all testcases <b>\u2264 10<sup>4</sup></b></li>\n\n</ul>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n<b>Subtask 2</b>: For further 20% of the score,\n<ul>\n<li>\n<b>1 \u2264 o<sub>1</sub> \u2264 10<sup>4</sup></b>\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>1 \u2264 o<sub>2</sub> \u2264 10<sup>2</sup></b>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n\n\n<p>\n<b>Subtask 3</b>: For further 70% of the score,\n<ul>\n<li>\nNo further constraints.</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n\n\n<p> </p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n4\n5 1\n1 0 0 1 1\n3 3\n0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0\n3 3\n1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0\n3 3\n1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n1\n1\n1\n0\n</pre>\n<p> </p>\n<h3>Explanation</h3>\n\n<p>\nIn the first testcase, each state should have only 1 district, and hence, there is no actual choice in constructing the states. There will be three One Governors, and two Zero Governors, and hence the President will be a One.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIn the second testcase, each of the three states should should have 3 districts each. Consider the following partitioning of the districts into states: {2,3,4}, {5,6,7} and {8,9,1}. So, the first state consists of the districts {2,3,4}, and the representatives of these correspond to {0,1,1}. The majority is One, and hence the first state will have a One Governor. The representatives corresponding to the second state are {0,1,1}, and so again, this will have a One Governor. The third state has representatives {0,0,0}, and hence will have a Zero Governor. On the whole, there are two One Governors, and one Zero Governor, and hence the President will be a One. And since there is a way to partition the districts into states, in which the President is a One, the answer is 1.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIn the third testcase, each of the three states should should have 3 districts each. Consider the following partitioning of the districts into states: {3,4,5}, {6,7,8} and {9,1,2}. So, the first state consists of the districts {3,4,5}, and the representatives of these correspond to {1,0,1}. The majority is One, and hence the first state will have a One Governor. The representatives corresponding to the second state are {0,0,1}, and since the majority is Zero, this will have a Zero Governor. The third state has representatives {0,1,1}, and as Ones are in majority, this will have a One Governor. On the whole, there are two One Governors, and one Zero Governor, and hence the President will be a One. And since there is a way to partition the districts into states, in which the President is a One, the answer is 1.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIn the fourth testcase, you can check that no matter how you construct the states, the President cannot be a One. Hence, the answer is 0.\n</p>\n\n",
