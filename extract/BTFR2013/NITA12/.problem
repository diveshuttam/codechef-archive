The game uses two rooted trees, each of which initially consists of one vertex with number 1. The player is given some sequence of operations. Each operation is characterized by three values (t, v, c) </p>\n<p>where:</p>\n<p>\u2022\tt is the number of the tree on which the operation is executed (1 or 2);\n</p><p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u2022\tv is the vertex index in this tree (it is guaranteed that the tree contains a vertex with this index);\n</p><p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u2022\tc is a lowercase English letter.</p>\n<p>The actual operation is as follows: vertex v of tree t gets a new descendant with number m\u2009+\u20091 (where m is the current number of vertices in tree t), and there should be letter c put on the new edge from vertex v to vertex m\u2009+\u20091.</p>\n<p>We'll say that an ordered group of three integers (i, j, q) is a good combination if:</p>\n<p>\u2022\t1\u2009\u2264\u2009i\u2009\u2264\u2009m1, where m1 is the number of vertices in the first tree;\n</p><p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u2022\t1\u2009\u2264\u2009j,\u2009q\u2009\u2264\u2009m2, where m2 is the number of vertices in the second tree;\n</p><p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u2022\tthere exists a forward path v1, v2, ..., vk such that v1\u2009=\u2009j and vk\u2009=\u2009q in the second tree;\n</p><p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u2022\tthe string that corresponds to the forward path in the second tree from vertex j to vertex q equals the string that corresponds to the backward path in the first tree from vertex i to vertex 1 (note that both paths are determined uniquely).\n</p><p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Your task is to calculate the number of existing good combinations after each operation on the trees.\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The first line contains integer n \u2014 the number of operations on the trees. Next n lines specify the operations in the order of their execution. Each line has form \"t v c\", where t is the number of the tree, v is the vertex index in this tree, and c is a lowercase English letter.</p>\n<p>Solve the problem with 1\u2009\u2264\u2009n\u2009\u2264\u200920000.\n</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>Print exactly n lines, each containing one integer \u2014 the number of existing good combinations after the corresponding operation from the input.\n</p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n5\n1 1 a\n2 1 a\n1 2 b\n2 1 b\n2 3 a\n<b>Output:</b>\n1\n3\n3\n4\n7\n</pre><p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p><b>After the first operation the only good combination was (1,\u20091,\u20091). After the second operation new good combinations appeared, (2,\u20091,\u20092) and (1,\u20092,\u20092). The third operation didn't bring any good combinations. The fourth operation added good combination (1,\u20093,\u20093). Finally, the fifth operation resulted in as much as three new good combinations \u2014 (1,\u20094,\u20094), (2,\u20093,\u20094) and (3,\u20091,\u20094).</b> ...</p>\n",
