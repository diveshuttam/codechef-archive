There is a Road he built but it was damaged after the monsoon because he stole half of the money given to him for building the road.<br />\nNow, it is his responsibility to fix the road. There are some holes on the road represented by 0s and plain road represented by 1s.He can only fill one hole i.e. he can only replace 0 by 1 once.  Shashank\u2019s job is to fix the road and make it as better as possible. Return \u2018-1\u2019 when there are no holes.</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n\n<p>The first line contains a single integer T, the number of test cases. T test cases follow. Each test case consists of a two lines. First line contains an integer \u2018N\u2019 which is the length of the road. Second line contains list of 0s and 1s separated by space.\n</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>For each test case output the index of 0 to be replaced to obtained the largest sequence of 1s in the list. Output  -1 when there are no holes.</p>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>T</b> \u2264 <b>1000</b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>N</b> \u2264 <b>10000</b></li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n2\n5\n1 0 1 1 0\n3\n1 1 1\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n1\n-1\n\n</pre><h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p>In first test case there are two zeroes if we replaced the zero at index 1 we get a sequence of four 1\u2019s  and if we replace the zero at the index 4 we get a sequence of three 1\u2019s. Therefore, output is 1.  </p>\n",
