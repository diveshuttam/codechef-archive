He is out of power and has only reserve power left to shoot a few lasers. Ultron has 26 different weak spots, each represented by an alphabet, where he can be hit, but the problem is he can make combination of those weak spots and make them function as a shield rather than weak spots. He can only be defeated if Iron Man shoots the lasers forming the smallest combination that is missing in Ultron\u2019s combination and that to in alphabetical order. Help Iron Man out to find what combination is to be shot to remove ultron\u2019s shield.</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>First line contains an integer \u2018T\u2019 which is the no. of test cases, followed by \u2018T\u2019 test cases.Each of the following line has a combination of ultron\u2019s shield he puts up every time represented by \u2018S\u2019.\n</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>For each combination output a combination that is to be shot.</p>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>T</b> \u2264 <b>1000</b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>T</b> \u2264 <b>100000</b></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n2\nxyqeaaabbcczw\naacbdefghijkhlmghnopqdgdfrsasdtuvwxyz\n\n<b>Output:</b>\nd\nab\n\n</pre><h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p>First combination has\u2018d\u2019 as the smallest combination missing in alphabetical order.<br /><br />\nSecond combination has \u2018ab\u2019 as the smallest combination missing in alphabetical order.\n</p>\n",
