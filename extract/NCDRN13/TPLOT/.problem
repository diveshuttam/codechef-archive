Every Saturday, six regular numbers and one<br />\nbonus number are drawn to determine the winners. The bonus number is only used with the second slot.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe winners are determined in the following manner:<br />\nNumber of Matches on the Ticket Prize</p>\n<table>\n<tr>\n<td>6 out of 6 regular number: \t\t\t </td>\n<td>First Parking slot</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5 out of 6 regular numbers and the bonus number: </td>\n<td>Second Parking slot</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n5 out of 6 regular numbers: \t\t\t </td>\n<td>Third Parking slot</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4 out of 6 regular numbers: \t\t\t </td>\n<td>Fourth Parking slot</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3 out of 6 regular numbers: \t\t\t </td>\n<td>Fifth Parking slot</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n2 out of 6, 1 out of 6, 0 out of 6: \t\t </td>\n<td>No Parking slot</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<p>now a student in uvce who has bought 5 tickets just to be sure wants to know whether he has actually won a slot??</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The input will contain six lines of data. The first line will contain the six regular numbers (in any random order) and the<br />\nbonus number, each separated by a space. The next five lines will each contain the six numbers (in<br />\nany random order) on each of the five tickets that the student has played. Each number is separated by a<br />\nspace.</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>The output will contain five lines of data, corresponding to each ticket line of the input . Each line will contain the<br />\nslot that the student has won, as described in the chart above.</p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Sample Input:</b>\n<p>\n35 22 42 28 20 11 25\n35 21 14 33 1 34\n35 42 16 22 38 8\n29 12 42 25 28 2\n25 28 22 11 20 35\n1 40 41 43 44 45\n</p>\n<b>Output:</b>\n\n<p>No Parking slot\nFifth Parking slot\nNo Parking slot\nSecond Parking slot\nNo Parking slot\u00a0</p></pre>",
