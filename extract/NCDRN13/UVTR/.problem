Traffic Manager of UVland want some one to help him to decide the expected traffic in certain circles.<br />\n\tIn a capital city of UVland there are <strong>N</strong> circles, numbered from 1 to N, at which road coming in to the circle diverges towards Left and Right, except the circles which are Ends. The main circle is starting point from which all the vehicles start moving.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tSome Traffic Rules of UVland are strange and unique, like</p>\n<ul>\n<li>At each circle first vehicle arriving there has to wait in the circle for second vehicle to arrive, when second vehicle arrives, first vehicle moves to Right and second vehicle moves to Left, again the third vehicle has to wait for forth vehicle, and on arrival of forth vehicle third vehicle moves to Right and forth vehicle moves to Left and same policy has to be followed for all vehicles which are expected to arrive.</li>\n<li>If any one of Left or Right road from a circle is closed then all the vehicles move in the road which is open and vehicles are not required to wait for next vehicles in such circles.</li>\n<li>Vehicles can move from Main circle to Ends but they cannot move in the reverse direction.</li>\n<li>Numbering of Circles is not in proper order. They number them randomly making no sense.</li>\n<li>and many more which are not much important.\n\t</li></ul>\n<p><br />\n\tAs Metro construction work is going on in the city some roads are closed making it difficult to expect the traffic at some circles.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tTraffic Manager gives you list of roads which are open, and expects <strong>V</strong> vehicles to arrive at main circle today. He want to know the expected traffic arriving at some set of circles. Write a program to help Traffic manager of UVland.\n</p>\n<h3>NOTE</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Given road network is always connected network.</li>\n<li>There are no loops in the networks.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>INPUT</h3>\n<p>\nFirst line contains three space separated integers <strong>N</strong>, Number of circles in the city, <strong>V</strong>, Number of vehicles expected to arrive at main circle and <strong>O</strong>, Number of roads which are open.<br />\nNext <strong>O</strong> lines contains 2 space separated integers <strong>FROM<sub>i</sub></strong> and <strong>TO<sub>i</sub></strong>, indicating that road connecting them is open.<br />\nNext line contains <strong>Q</strong>, Number of circles, in which expected traffic has to found.<br />\nNext <strong>Q</strong> line contains a single integer <strong>C<sub>i</sub></strong>, number indicating the Circle at which expected traffic has to be found.\n</p>\n<h3>OUTPUT</h3>\n<p>\n\tPrint <strong>Q</strong> lines containing expected traffic at <strong>C<sub>i</sub></strong>.\n</p>\n<h3>\nCONSTRAINTS</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>1 \u2264 <strong>O</strong> \u2264 <strong>N</strong> \u2264 10<sup>5</sup></li>\n<li>1 \u2264 <strong>V</strong> \u2264 10<sup>12</sup></li>\n<li>1 \u2264 <strong>Q</strong>,<strong>C<sub>i</sub></strong>,<strong>FROM<sub>i</sub></strong>, <strong>TO<sub>i</sub></strong> \u2264 <strong>N</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>EXAMPLE</h3>\n<p><b>Input</b></p>\n<p>\n4 9 3<br />\n3 4<br />\n4 1<br />\n4 2<br />\n4<br />\n1<br />\n2<br />\n3<br />\n4\n</p>\n<p><b>Output</b></p>\n<p>\n4<br />\n4<br />\n9<br />\n9\n</p>\n",
