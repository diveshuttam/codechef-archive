At CodeChef, we work hard to revive the geek in you by hosting a programming contest at the start of the month and another smaller programming challenge in the middle of the month.</p> </div> <p><br /> <b class=\"rules-heading\">About CodeChef October LunchTime:</b></p> <div class=\"rules-body\"> <p>CodeChef LunchTime is the Junior Programming series aimed at providing a fun contest to the students of middle/high school.

You can know more about prizes <a href=\"http://discuss.codechef.com/questions/51999/how-do-i-win-a-codechef-goodie\">here</a>.
