Now she starts swapping the array elements. She can swap any number by a number that is immediate left to that number. For a particular number this operation can be performed up to a maximum of two times. For e.g. if n=5, the array elements are 1,2,3,4,5 . 5 can be swapped by 4 and then 5 can be swapped again by 3. Then the array would look like 1,2,5,3,4. Now you cannot swap 5 by 2 as it has performed its swap 2 times. <br /><br />\nGiven the present form of array you need to tell how was it achieved using minimum number of swaps. If it is not possible to obtain this form print \"Impossible\" (without the quotes).\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The first line contains an integer, T, denoting the number of test cases.<br />\nEach test case is comprised of two lines; the first line has n (an integer indicating the number of elements in the array), and the second line has n space-separated integers describing the final state of the array.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>Print an integer denoting the minimum number of swaps needed to find the present form of the array<br />Print \"Impossible\" (without the double quotes) if the state is invalid (It requires more two operations for a particular number).</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>T</b> \u2264 <b>10</b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>n</b> \u2264 <b>100000</b></li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n2\n5\n2 1 5 3 4\n5\n2 5 1 3 4\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n3\nImpossible\n</pre><p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p><b>Example case 2.</b> 5 has moved more than two places in front which is not possible. </p>\n",
