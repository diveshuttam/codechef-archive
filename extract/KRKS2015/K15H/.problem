She being faithful to Lady Stark ventured on a mission to find her daughters and bring them to Lady Lysa. The sword 'oathkeeper' was made of Valyrian steel which had some strange binary numbers encoded along the length of the sword. Podrick Payne was a playful squire and was constantly playing with Brienne's sword which irritated her. She being a 'math wizard' in an another other life, posed Podrick a question based on the binary numbers encoded on the steel.\n </p>\n<p>  Podrick was asked to answer the question or leave her. Seven being a holy number in Westeros, Brienne came up with a question based on the number '7'.\n  </p>\n<p>  Podrick was asked to find the maximum number of disjoint substring partitions from the original binary string such that each binary substring when converted into decimal is divisible by 7 and each substring taken must contain atleast one '1'(since Brienne likes the '1').\n  </p>\n<p> Since Podrick couldn't do this, he requested your help to compute it using your computer. HELP HIM!!!</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>First line contains 'T', the number of test cases.<br />\nEach test case contains a binary string S.</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>For each string 'S', output the number of binary partitions divisible by 7 on each line</p>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n\n<p> 1&lt;=T &lt;= 100\n </p>\n<p>|S| length of string &lt;= 2500\n </p>\n<p>The string will contain only characters '0' and '1'.</p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n<samp>\n3\n11100111\n10011000\n111\n</samp>\n<b>Output:</b>\n<samp>\n2\n0\n1\n</samp>\n</pre><h3>Explanation</h3>\n\n<p>In the first string, one solution has two partitions 111 from index 0-2 and 111 from index 5-7. Another solution has partitions 1110 from index 0-3 and 0111 from index 4-7.\n</p>\n\n<p>In the second string no substring is divisble by 7</p>\n",
