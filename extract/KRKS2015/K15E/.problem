It was an ordinary river of width W. He wanted to make it interesting. So, he challenged himself to reach a point on other side of the river and D distance downwards from the point he stands now. He can swim at the speed of S kmph and run at the speed of R kmph. He can reach any point X on the other side of the river by swimming and then run to the destination. He has to reach the destination as soon as possible. Find the distance of point X from the destination(same as the distance he must run) and also the total time of travel.\u00a0</p>\n<p><img src=\"/download/extimages/7365e2ac3121a38f3cad6229c8ddc4b9.png\" /></p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>First line contains the number of test cases T.</p>\n<p>Each test cases is represented by one line containing four integers W, D, S and R (space separated).</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>For each test case print a line containing two numbers G and H(space separated),<br /></p>\n<p>G is the distance from destination to point X and H is the number of hours taken to reach the destination.</p>\n<p><b>Relative error up to 10^-2 allowed.</b></p>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<p>1 &lt;= T &lt;= 10^5</p>\n<p>0 &lt;= W, D &lt;= 10^9</p>\n<p>1 &lt;= S, R &lt;= 10^9</p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<p><b>Input:</b><br /><br />\n<samp><br />\n2<br /><br />\n10 10 5 5<br /><br />\n3 8 6 8<br /><br />\n<br /><br />\n</samp><br />\n<b>Output:</b><br /><br />\n<samp><br />\n0 2.828427<br /><br />\n4.598320 1.330719<br /><br />\n</samp></p>\n<h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p>Case #1: He will swim directly to destination and never runs.
