Each resident owns a personal computer. There are direct connections between <b>E</b> pairs of computers. Pairs of computers not directly connected can still communicate if there is a path between them in the network.</p>\n<p>All <b>N</b> residents are fans of Basketball, but each one has their own favorite team. The <b>i</b>th resident's favorite team is team <b>G<sub>i</sub></b>. Naturally, fans of the same team want to communicate with each other via the network.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, Chef isn't too knowledgeable about computers so he didn't ensure that all pairs of computers can communicate with each other. We call a pair of residents <b>(i, j)</b> <b>sad</b> if they have the same favorite team (i.e., <b>G<sub>i</sub></b> = <b>G<sub>j</sub></b>) but they can't communicate with each other. Thus, there can be many sad pairs in the network right now.</p>\n<p>Even worse, from time to time, someone gets disconnected from the network, further increasing the number of sad pairs. When a resident is disconnected, all direct connections to and from his/her computer becomes unusable.</p>\n<p>Chef didn't anticipate all these problems and has turned to you for help. Your first task is to submit a report containing <b>N</b> integers, where the <b>i</b>th integer is <i>the number of sad pairs in the network if the <b>i</b>th resident was disconnected</i>.</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The first line contains two integers, <b>N</b> and <b>E</b>.</p>\n<p>The second line contains <b>N</b> space-separated integers <b>G<sub>1</sub></b>, <b>G<sub>2</sub></b>, ..., <b>G<sub>N</sub></b> denoting the residents' favorite teams.</p>\n<p>The following <b>E</b> lines each contains two integers, <b>a<sub>i</sub></b> and <b>b<sub>i</sub></b>, which means that there is a direct connection between computers of resident <b>a<sub>i</sub></b> and <b>b<sub>i</sub></b>. Connections are bidirectional.</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>Output <b>N</b> lines. The <b>i</b>th line must contain a single integer, the number of sad pairs if the <b>i</b>th resident was disconnected from the network.</p>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b>5</b> \u2264 <b>N</b> \u2264 <b>2\u00d710<sup>5</sup></b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>G<sub>i</sub></b> \u2264 <b>10<sup>6</sup></b></li>\n<li><b>0</b> \u2264 <b>E</b> \u2264 <b>min(2\u00d710<sup>5</sup>, <b>N(N-1)/2</b>)</b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>a<sub>i</sub></b> &lt; <b>b<sub>i</sub></b> \u2264 <b>N</b></li>\n<li>No pair (<b>a<sub>i</sub></b>, <b>b<sub>i</sub></b>) will appear more than once in the input.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Subtasks</h3>\n<p>\n<b>Subtask #1: (25 points)</b> Every computer can communicate with at most 59 other computers.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Subtask #2: (75 points)</b> No additional constraints.\n</p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n<tt>7 6\n1 3 3 1 1 3 1\n1 2\n2 3\n1 3\n4 5\n5 6\n6 7\n</tt>\n<b>Output:</b>\n<tt>5\n6\n6\n7\n8\n7\n7\n</tt></pre><h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p>In the given network, residents 1, 4, 5 and 7 all have team 1 as their favorite, and 2, 3 and 6 all have team 3 as their favorite.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If resident 1 is disconnected, then there are 5 sad pairs: (1,4), (1,5), (1,7), (2,6), (3,6).</li>\n<li>If resident 2 is disconnected, then there are 6 sad pairs: (1,4), (1,5), (1,7), (2,3), (2,6), (3,6).</li>\n<li>If resident 3 is disconnected, then there are 6 sad pairs: (1,4), (1,5), (1,7), (2,3), (2,6), (3,6).</li>\n<li>If resident 4 is disconnected, then there are 7 sad pairs: (1,4), (1,5), (1,7), (2,6), (3,6), (4,5), (4,7).</li>\n<li>If resident 5 is disconnected, then there are 8 sad pairs: (1,4), (1,5), (1,7), (2,6), (3,6), (4,5), (4,7), (5,7).</li>\n<li>If resident 6 is disconnected, then there are 7 sad pairs: (1,4), (1,5), (1,7), (2,6), (3,6), (4,7), (5,7).</li>\n<li>If resident 7 is disconnected, then there are 7 sad pairs: (1,4), (1,5), (1,7), (2,6), (3,6), (4,7), (5,7).</li>\n</ul>\n",
