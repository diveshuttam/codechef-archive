His task is described below.</p>\n<p>There are N battleships represented as N points on the plane. The <b>radius</b> of a ship is defined to be the distance from that ship to the ship closest to it. The <b>effective set</b> for a ship is defined to be the set of all ships (excluding itself) which are at a distance from that ship of <b>no more than twice</b> its radius. The number of elements in the effective set of a ship is called the <b>effective value</b> of that ship.</p>\n<p>Johnny needs to write a program to calculate the radius and the effective value of each battleship. This task is so tough that without your help, Johnny could never finish it. Let's help him!</p>\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The first line contains t, the number of test cases (about 5). Then t test cases follow. Each test case has the following form:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The first line contains an integer N, the number of battleships (1 <= N <= 30000).</li>\n<li>Each line in the next N lines contains two integers X, Y (0 <= X, Y <= 10000) represents the coordinates of a battleship.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Each test case's input is separated by a blank line. There may be more than one ships located at the same place.</p>\n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>For each test case, print N lines. Each line should contain two numbers which are the radius and the effective value of the corresponding battleship. The radius should be rounded to 2 decimal points.</p>\n<p>Print a blank line after each test case's output.</p>\n\n<h3>Example</h3>\n\n<pre>\n<b>Input</b>\n2\n\n3\n0 0\n0 0\n3 4\n\n5\n5 3\n7 8\n0 9\n3 1\n4 4\n\n<b>Output</b>\n0.00 1\n0.00 1\n5.00 2\n\n1.41 2\n5.00 4\n6.40 4\n2.83 2\n1.41 1\n</pre>",
