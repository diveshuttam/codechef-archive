For example, 5115 and 929 are such numbers, while 31 and 125 are not. Johnny calls such numbers palindromic numbers.</p>\n<p>After a while, Johnny has realized that his definition of palindromic numbers is not really precise. Whether a number is palindromic or not depends on the base in which the number is written. For example, 21 is not palindromic in base 10 but it is palindromic in base 2 (because 21 = 10101<sub>2</sub>).</p>\n<p>Johnny finds it interesting that any number becomes palindromic when it is written in an appropriate base.</p>\n<p>Given a number N, write a program to help Johnny compute the smallest base B such that N is palindromic when written in base B.</p>\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The first line contains t, the number of test cases (about 1000). Then t test cases follow.</p>\n<p>Each test case consists of a number N written in one line (1 <= N <= 10<sup>10</sup>).</p>\n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>For each given number N, print a line containing the smallest base B such that N is palindromic in base B.</p>\n\n<h3>Example</h3>\n\n<pre>\n<b>Input:</b>\n3\n1\n4\n21\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n2\n3\n2\n</pre>\n",
