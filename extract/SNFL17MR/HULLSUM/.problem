At least one such set exists for every <b>N</b> allowed by the constraints given below.</p>\n\n<p>Note: Remember that you don't print <b>N</b> in the first line.</p>\n\n\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>2 \u2264 <b>N</b> \u2264 50</b>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>Example</h3>\n\n<pre>\n<b>Input:</b>\n5\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n-150 150\n150 150\n-150 -150\n150 -150\n11 13\n</pre>\n\n\n\n<h3>Explanation</h3>\n\n<p>Let's analyze sizes of convex hulls for the provided output.\nThere are 2<sup>5</sup>-1 non-empty sets of points.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>There are 5 sets of points that consist of only 1 point each.\nThe convex hull of each of those sets has size 1.</li>\n<li>Similarly, 10 sets of points consist of 2 points each, and the size of each of their convex hulls is 2.</li>\n<li>Similarly, there are 10 sets with 3 points each, and the size of each of their convex hulls is 3.</li>\n<li>The set with points (-150, -150), (-150, 150), (150, 150), (11, 13) has a convex hull of size 3.
