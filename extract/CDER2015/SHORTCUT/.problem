She has been strictly warned by her parents to travel though the main streets only and not any alleys. The party was at the north-west top-most location of the town while her house is at the south-east end. </p>\n<p>So the only ways she can travel is to the cross-roads in front of her or the one to her right. Both those cross-roads are equi-distant. </p>\n<p>At every cross-roads she reaches, she again gets the same two options. </p>\n<p>She wants to know in how many ways can she reach her home. Help her solve this problem so that she can reach home safely.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Input:</em></strong></p>\n<p>t testcases</p>\n<p>one m in each line</p>\n<p><strong><em>Constraints:</em></strong></p>\n<p>1&lt;=t&lt;=15</p>\n<p>1&lt;=m&lt;=14</p>\n<p><strong><em>Output:</em></strong></p>\n<p>Output should contain an integer in each line corresponding to the number of ways possible,</p>\n<p>Here, (0,0) corresponds to the top-left point of the grid and (m,m) corresponds to the bottom-right point of the grid.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"enter image description here\" src=\"/download/extimages/49b0db45269d742e804dbe1647829c6e.gif\" /></p>\n<p><br /><b>Sample Input:</b><br />\n<br />3<br />1<br />2<br />3<br /><br />\n<b>Sample Output:</b><br />\n<br />2<br />6<br />20</p>\n",
