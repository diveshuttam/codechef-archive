Their job is to ensure that all items are out for delivery by tagging them with appropriate destinations. Out of these 3 people, $X$ is very generous and performs all the tasks given to him. $Y$ and $Z$ are very stubborn and will work on only those deliveries which costs less than or equal to $R$. $Z$ copies whatever $Y$ does. You are given $N$ deliveries, where cost of each delivery $Ci$ is known. Help Chef to know, how many deliveries can $X$, $Y$ and $Z$ do individually, if all the work has to be done by just one of them.\n\n\n###Input:\n\n- First line will contain $T$, number of testcases.\n- Each testcase starts with $N$ and $R$.\n- Next line consists of $N$ spaced integers, describing cost $C$ of each delivery.\n\n\n###Output:\nFor each testcase, output in a single line for $X$, $Y$ and $Z$ with space in between.\n\n\n###Constraints \n- $1 \\leq T \\leq 1000$\n- $1 \\leq N \\leq 10^6$\n- $1 \\leq R \\leq 10^9$\n\n\n###Sample Input:\n\t1\n\t4 3\n\t1 2 3 4\n\n\n###Sample Output:\n\t4 3 3\t\t\n\t\n",
