This cuboid consists of negative and positive integers ( including 0 ), placed one at each unit place.     \n( Informally, the given cuboid is a collection of $L * B * H$  integers placed in cuboidal order ) \n\nConsider a Contiguous Sub-Cuboid ( from the given cuboid ) of length $D$, breadth $E$ and height $F$.           \n$( 1 <= D <= L )$     \n$( 1 <= E <= B )$    \n$( 1 <= F <= H )$     \n( Note that the Sub-Cuboid must be Non-Empty, that is it must have at least 1 integer present in it ) \n\nLet us define the Worth $W$ of this Sub-Cuboid as the summation of all the integers contained in that Sub-Cuboid.    \nAlso, let us define the Volume $V$ of this Sub-Cuboid as $D * E * F$  \nFinally, let us define the Power $P$ of this Sub-Cuboid as $W * V$ \n\nYou have to find 2 Non-Empty Contiguous Sub-Cuboids from the given cuboid, such that :    \nThe first Sub-Cuboid should have the maximum possible Worth, $Wmax$.    \nThe second Sub-Cuboid should have the maximum possible Power, $Pmax$.\n   \n( Note that $Wmax$ is the Worth of the Sub-Cuboid with maximum possible Worth and $Pmax$ is the Power of the Sub-Cuboid with maximum possible Power )\n\n\n###Input:\n\nPlease read the input format carefully.    \nAssume the corner of the cuboid to be placed at the origin ( 0 , 0 , 0 ) of a 3-D region ( X , Y , Z ). Assume the length to be in X-direction, the breadth to be in Y-direction and the height to be in Z-direction. \n\nThe first line of the Input consists of a single integer  $T$ denoting the number of Test Cases.    \nThe description of  $T$ test cases follow:    \nThe first line of each test case consists of 3 space-separated integers $L$, $B$ and $H$, the length, the breadth and the height of the given cuboid.    \n$H$ sets of lines follow :    \nEach of these sets consists of $B$ lines. Each of these lines consists of $L$ space-separated integers.    \nThe $ith$ integer in the $jth$ line of the $kth$ set denote $A(i,j,k)$, which is the integer present at the location $( i-1 , j-1 , k-1 )$ in the 3-D region.    \n( 1 <= i <= L )     \n( 1 <= j <= B )     \n( 1 <= k <= H )\n\n###Output:\nFor each test case, output a single line which should consist of 2 space-separated integers $Wmax$ and $Pmax$ , the answers to the corresponding test case.\n\n\n###Constraints \n- $1 \\leq T \\leq 100$\n- $1 \\leq L, B, H \\leq 10$\n- $-10^9 \\leq A(i,j,k) \\leq 10^9$\n\n\n###Sample Input:\n2    \n4 3 2    \n4 -1 -2 -4    \n-5 -2 -9 0    \n1 0 -2 -7    \n-3 -5 -2 0    \n-7 1 -2 -4    \n-9 -8 -2 -4    \n2 2 2    \n65 1    \n-1 -1    \n-1 -1    \n-1 -1    \n\n\n###Sample Output:\n4 6    \n66 480\n\n\t\n###EXPLANATION:\nTest Case 1 :\n\nThe cuboid with maximum Worth Wmax is the one containing the integer(s) at the coordinate(s) - ( 0 , 0 , 0 ) \nWmax = 4\n\nThe cuboid with maximum Power Pmax is the one containing the integer(s) at the coordinate(s) - ( 0 , 0 , 0 ) , ( 1 , 0 , 0 )\nW = 4 + (-1) = 3, \nV = 2 * 1 * 1 = 2, \nPmax = 3*2 = 6\n\n( Note that the cuboid with maximum Worth cannot be the cuboid with maximum Power in this case because it has Volume V = 1 which gives it Power P = 4*1 = 4, which is less than 6 )\n\nTest Case 2 : \n\nThe cuboid with maximum Worth Wmax is the one containing the integer(s) at the coordinate(s) - ( 0 , 0 , 0 ) , ( 1 , 0 , 0 )\nWmax = 65 + 1 = 66\n\nThe cuboid with maximum Power Pmax is the one containing the integer(s) at the coordinate(s) - ( 0 , 0 , 0 ) , ( 1 , 0 , 0 ) , ( 0 , 1 , 0 ) , ( 1 , 1 , 0 ) , ( 0 , 0 , 1 ) , ( 1 , 0 , 1 ) , ( 0 , 1 , 1 ) , ( 1 , 1 , 1 )\nW = 65 + 1 + (-1) + (-1) + (-1) + (-1) + (-1) + (-1) = 60\nV = 2*2*2 = 8\nPmax= 60*8 = 480\n.\n",
