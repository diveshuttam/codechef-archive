Here, people eat chocolates daily instead of normal food. There is only one shop near your home; this shop is closed on Sunday, but open on all other days of the week. You may buy <b>at most one</b> box of <b>N</b> chocolates from this shop on each day when it is open.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nCurrently, it's Monday, and you need to survive for the next <b>S</b> days (including the current day). You have to eat <b>K</b> chocolates everyday (including the current day) to survive. Do note that you are allowed to buy the a chocolate box and eat from it on the same day.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nCompute the minimum number of days on which you need to buy from the shop so that you can survive the next <b>S</b> days, or determine that it isn't possible to survive.\n</p>\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The first line of the input contains a single integer <b>T</b> denoting the number of test cases. The description of <b>T</b> test cases follows.</li>\n<li>The first and only line of each test case contains 3 integers <b>N</b>, <b>K</b> and <b>S</b> denoting the number of chocolates in a box, the number of chocolates you have to eat everyday to survive and the number of days you need to survive.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>For each test case, print a single line containing one integer \u2014 the minimum number of days on which you need to buy from the shop to survive, or -1 if you will not be able to survive <b>S</b> days.</p>\n\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>1 \u2264 <b>T</b> \u2264 100</li>\n<li>1 \u2264 <b>N</b> \u2264 100</li>\n<li>1 \u2264 <b>K</b> \u2264 100</li>\n<li>1 \u2264 <b>S</b> \u2264 1000</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n2\n16 2 10\n50 48 7\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n2\n-1\n</pre>\n\n<h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p><b>Example case 1:</b> One possible solution is to buy a box on day 1 (Monday); it's sufficient to eat from this box up to day 8 (Monday) inclusive. Now, on day 9 (Tuesday), you buy another box and use the chocolates in it to survive days 9 and 10.</p>\n<p><b>Example case 2:</b> You will not be able to survive even if you buy from the shop everyday except every 7-th day.</p>\n",
