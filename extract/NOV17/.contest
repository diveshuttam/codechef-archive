At CodeChef, we work hard to revive the geek in you by hosting a programming contest at the start of the month and another smaller programming challenge in the middle of the month.</p>\r\n<h4>About CodeChef November Long Challenge:</h4>\r\n<p class=\"last\">CodeChef Long Challenge is a 10-day monthly coding contest where you can show off your computer programming skills. The significance being - it gives you enough time to think about a problem, try different ways of attacking the problem, read the concepts etc. If you\u2019re usually slow at solving problems and have ample time at hand, this is ideal for you. We also put in a lot of efforts in getting quality problems, which would, in turn, foster your learning while solving them.</p>\r\n<h4>Contest Details:</h4>\r\n<ul class=\"last\">\r\n<li><b>Duration: </b>10 Days, From 3rd November 1500 hrs IST to 13<sup>th</sup> November 1500 hrs IST. Check your timezone <a href=\"https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=CodeChef+November+Challenge+2017&amp;iso=20171103T15&amp;p1=44\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>Eligibility Criteria: Anyone with a knack for Programming :P</h4>\r\n<p class=\"last\">Our contests are open to all the programmers across the globe.</p>\r\n<h4>What's in it for you?</h4>\r\n<p>The idea behind these programming contests is that we want you to learn while competing. Also we believe that it is alright to refer to tutorials, books and other materials, learn a concept and then apply the same to solve a problem during a contest. But it is not alright to copy other people's solutions or seek other people's help to solve a problem without understanding it. The dividing line may seem to be thin but it can be captured by the spirit of learning. If whatever you are doing is making you learn while you do so, we tend to believe that it is alright. However, all the participants are expected to abide to <a class=\"button blue\" href=\"http://discuss.codechef.com/questions/18662/does-codechef-have-any-code-of-conduct\">CodeChef Code Of Conduct</a></p>\r\n<p>Not just that, as a token of motivation we also give away cash prizes and goodies to the winners of the contest. However, our sole intention lies in making our users learn new concepts while competing. You can know more about prizes <a href=\"http://discuss.codechef.com/questions/51999/how-do-i-win-a-codechef-goodie\">here</a>. FYI, here are the list of cash prizes:</p>\r\n<p><b>For Indians:</b></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>1st prize: INR 12000/-</li>\r\n<li>2nd prize: INR 8000/-</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><b>For Rest of World:</b></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>1st prize: $400</li>\r\n<li>2nd prize: $300</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p class=\"last\">With CodeChef laddus, the winners can claim cool CodeChef goodies.

Posting questions clarifying the problem statement is ok. If you are unsure, email us at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:feedback@codechef.com\"> feedback@codechef.com</a>.</li>\r\n<li><b>All the problems will be partially graded and you will get a score for passing certain test data (except tie-breaker problem). You will receive hundred (100) point for solving a problem (passing all test cases).</b></li>\r\n<li><b>The details of the failed test cases will also be visible on your solution page (except challenge problem)</b></li>\r\n<li>You can submit solutions as many times as you'd like, there are no penalties for incorrect submissions.</li>\r\n<li>Each contest will have one min/max tie breaker problem, where the best solution will receive one point and all other solutions will receive a fraction based how close they come to the best solution.</li>\r\n<li>You shall not possess more than one account on CodeChef. If you have, then do let us know, so that we can deactivate the insignificant one. If you do not report it and we come to know about it, we may deactivate both the accounts permanently.</li>\r\n<li>The score that you will see during the contest (for tie-breaker problem), will only be partial (obtained on 20% of the test data). The submissions will be re-judged at the end of the contest to get a full score (obtained on the whole test data).</li>\r\n<li>The number of submissions that one can make during the contest on the problem will be limited to 500 and the maximum number of submissions allowed in the <b>challenge problem</b> are limited to <b>200</b>. </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><b>Note: You can now \"Code, Compile, and Run\" your codes on our newly launched <a href=\"/ide\">Online IDE</a>.</b></p>\r\n<p>However, if you are using any other online development environment, make sure that other contestants don't have access to your code.
