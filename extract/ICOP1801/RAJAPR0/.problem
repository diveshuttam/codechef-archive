His peers are tired of him answering every one of their questions and together pose a seemingly difficult problem to him. They gave Raja a map which has <b>N</b> (numbered 1 to N) cities. <b>N-1</b> bidirectional roads connect the cities. Each city is connected by atleast 1 road. \n</p>\n<p>They then ask Raja <b> Q </b> questions. In each question, he is given 2 cities and he has to tell them the parity of the length of the shortest path between the cities. The length of a path is the number of roads that have to be used in it.\n</p>\n<p>\nRaja tells his peers that the question is trivial, but they don\u2019t believe him. So Raja asks you to do it on his behalf, as he does not like to waste time on ez questions.\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The first line has an Integer <b>N</b>, the number of cities. The next <b>N-1</b> lines have 2 space-separated integers <b>u v</b>. This means that a bidirected road connects city <b>u</b> and city <b>v</b>. The next line has an integer <b>Q</b>, the number of questions. The next <b>Q</b> lines have 2 space-separated integers <b>a b</b>, the cities for which Raja has to tell the answer.</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p> For each question, output a single line with the word \u201cOdd\u201d if the length of the shortest path between <b> a </b>and <b>b </b>is an odd integer and \u201cEven\u201d if the length of the shortest path between <b>a</b> and <b>b</b> is an even integer.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n1<b><=</b>u, v, a, b <b><=</b> N\n<ul>\n<li><b>Subtask 1(15 points):</b> 1<=N<=10^5 1<=Q<=42\n<li><b>Subtask 2(15 points):</b> 1<=N<=100 1<=Q<=10^6\n<li><b>Subtask 3(20 points):</b> 1<=N<=10^3 1<=Q<=10^6\n<li><b>Subtask 4(50 points):</b> 1<=N<=10^5 1<=Q<=10^6\n</ul>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n4\n1 2\n2 3\n1 4\n2\n4 3\n2 4\n\n<b>Output:</b>\nOdd\nEven\n</pre>\n<p>\u00a0</p>",
