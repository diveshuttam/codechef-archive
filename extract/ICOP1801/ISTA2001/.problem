The corner diagonally opposite to the corner on the origin is located on the point <b>(X, Y, Z)</b>. You can verify that each triplet of <b>(X, Y, Z)</b> uniquely identifies a cuboid. The ant wishes to travel from the origin to the corner on <b>(X, Y, Z)</b>. Can you help him find the shortest path to minimize his workload(Even though he carries 20 times his own body wieght, he is mentally weak but you are not!)?<br><br>Additionally, the ant also desires to have an integer length path.\n To make the path length an integer, the ant will travel an extra distance in any way. As you might observe, its easy to travel an extra distance to make it an integer.</p>\n\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>Input description.</p>\n<p>The first line of the input contains an integer <b>T</b> denoting the number of test cases. The following <b>T</b> lines contain three space separeted integers\u00a0<b>X</b>, <b>Y</b> and <b>Z</b>, the coordinates of the corner of the cuboid which is located diagonally opposite to the corner which is situated on the origin.</p>\n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>For each test case, output a single line containing only one integer <b>S</b>, the answer to the given problem.</p>\n\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>T</b> \u2264 <b>2 * 10<sup>5</sup></b></li>\n<li><b>0</b> \u2264 <b>X, Y, Z</b> \u2264 <b>10<sup>9</sup></b></li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n\n<h3>Subtasks</h3>\n<p>\n<b>Subtask #1(10 points):</b>\n<ul>\n<li>At least one of the coordinates is 0</li>\n</ul>\n<b>Subtask #2(90 points):</b>\n<ul>\n<li>Original constraints</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n2\n1 1 1\n1 0 1\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n3\n2\n</pre>\n</p>\n<h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p>\n<b>Example case 1.</b><br>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/70E9biY.png\" />\n<br>\nYou can see that the ant can take the path A -> C -> F shown in the figure above to get the desired result. The shortest path is \u221a \u03052+1 = 1.414 + 1 = 2.414. You can see that if the ant traces back a distance of 0.293 units and then turns around to continue the path. This adds a total of 2*0.293 = 0.586 units. So, answer is 2.414+0.586 = 3 units.<br>Alternatively, even the below is valid.<br>\n<img src = \"https://i.imgur.com/5erCO28.png\" /><br>\nEven the above diagram produces a path length of 3 units. In any case, you can verify that path length of 2 is not possible.\n<br><br>\n<b>Example case 2.</b><br>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/vVIFn8T.png\" />\n<br>\nThe image explains itself. You can apply the same logic as example 1 to make the path length an integer.<br>\n</p>",
