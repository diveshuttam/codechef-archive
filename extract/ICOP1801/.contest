    "announcements": "The statement for TIDUAFT is updated. Sorry for the inconvenience. <br><br>\r\n\r\nIn ISTA2001, the ant can travel in any of the faces, edges and corners as like in a real life situation. Also, ants don't fly.<br><br>\r\n\r\nTIDURAT Problem Statement Clarification:\r\n\"They first contest they will allow Tidu to compete in is the contest with index x. Also, they set up a condition of participation for more contests Formally, to participate in a contest with index k (k not equal to x): Tidu Can participate in contest k only if tk>tx. If the last contest Tidu participated in is the contest with index i and his rating after it is ri, he cannot participate in contest k (rating rk) if there is a contest (say contest j) between the time ti and tk in which Tidu can attain a rating greater than ri but lower than rk. That is, there should be no j such that t i < tj < tk. and ri < rj < rk.\"\r\n\r\nThis means that Tidu can't participate in contest k if there is a contest j with t<sub>j</sub> in the range (t<sub>i</sub>, t<sub>k</sub>) with r<sub>i</sub> < r<sub>j</sub> < r<sub>k</sub> where i is the index of the contest with the highest time Udit has taken part in till now. <br><br>\r\n\r\nTidurat sample explanation has been posted and statement has been updated. <br><br>\r\n\r\nContest Over. Hope you enjoyed it. Editorials will be posted soon. <br><br>\r\n",

The primary goal of the IOI is to stimulate interest in informatics (computing science) and information technology. Another important goal is to bring together exceptionally talented pupils from various countries and to have them share scientific and cultural experiences.<br />The IOI is organized annually in and by one of the participating countries. Each participating country typically sends a delegation of four contestants and two accompanying adults. Students compete individually and try to maximize their score by solving a set of informatics problems during two competition days. Cultural and recreational events are organized on the remaining days.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10px; font-weight: normal;\"><strong class=\"rules-heading\">About Indian Computing Olympiad<br /></strong></p>\r\n<p>The Indian Computing Olympaid consists of Zonal Computing Olympiad, Zonal Informatics Olympiad, Indian National Olympiad in Informatics and IOI Training Camp which is conducted by the Indian Association for Research in Computing Science(IARCS) as procedure of selection to the IOI.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10px; font-weight: normal;\"><strong class=\"rules-heading\">Eligibility Criteria: Anyone with a knack for Programming :P</strong></p>\r\n<div class=\"rules-body\" style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10px; font-weight: normal;\">\r\n<p>Our contests are open to all the programmers across the globe.
