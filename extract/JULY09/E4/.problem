Click <a href=\"http://blog.codechef.com/2009/08/27/tutorial-for-problem-quadratic-equations/\">here</a> to read it. </h3>\n\n<p>Knowing Johnny's mathematical talent, our teacher has prepared a new interesting problem for him, hoping he will enjoy solving it. The problem description is given below.</p>\n<p>\"There is a rectangular room of length l and width w (l and w are integers). The length and width of the room\u00a0 fulfill the relation l=Aw+B, where A and B are given integer constants. The room is divided into square cells of unit dimensions. You have observed that, after adding an integer C to the number of cells in the room, the number of cells becomes divisible by the prime number P. Find all the possible values of the width of the room.\"</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The first line contains t, the number of test cases (about 10000). Then t test cases follow. Each test case is given in one line containing 4 integers A, B, C and P (2 \u2264 P &lt; 10<sup>6</sup>, 0 &lt; A &lt; P, 0 \u2264 B,C &lt; P).</p>\n<p>P is always a prime number.</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>For each test case, write the result in one line. The first number K is the number of solutions. Then K numbers X<sub>1</sub>, X<sub>2</sub>, ...,X<sub>K</sub> follow (0 \u2264 X<sub>i</sub> &lt; P) in increasing order, which are the solutions to the corresponding problems.</p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><strong>Input:</strong>\n2\n1 1 0 2\n1 2 2 3\n\n<strong>Output:</strong>\n2 0 1\n0\n</pre>",
