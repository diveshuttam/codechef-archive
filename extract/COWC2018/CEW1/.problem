The God of Death, Hela, is tired of her job so she arrives on Earth to recruit people and appoint them as her assistants. She includes Shah and Rukh in her list along with others. She takes all of them to a place named Asguard to start the recruitment process. As Hela decides to recruit only two of them, she gives a deadly task of survival. \n<p>Hela asks all the <b>N</b> people (including Shah and Rukh) to stand in a circle in order from <b>1</b> to <b>N</b> and gives a Death Sword to the person standing at position 1 in the circle.\n<p>Person at position 1 has to kill his next person (person at position 2) and handover the sword to the next person (person at position 3). This process goes on (without changing the direction) until only two of them survives. Since Shah is a programmer, he makes himself stand at a position such that, at the end he has the sword and only Rukh is remaining, so that both are alive and get recruited by Hela.\n<p>Since, you are a film-geek, you have to predict the position where Shah will be standing and also the position where Shah makes his friend, Rukh to stand.\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Input Format</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The first line of the input contains an integer <b>T</b> denoting the number of test cases . \n</li>\n<li> Next T lines contain an integer <b>N</b> denoting number of people standing in circle in order.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<p></p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>T</b> \u2264 <b>10<sup>5</sup></b>\n</li>\n<li><b>2</b> \u2264 <b>N</b> \u2264 <b>10<sup>18</sup></b>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<h3>Output Format</h3>\n<p> For each test case, print two space separated numbers, Shah\u2019s position and Rukh\u2019s position respectively. <br>\n<p></p>\n\n\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n<br>\n3<br>\n5<br>\n2<br>\n4<br>\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n<br>\n3 5<br>\n1 2<br>\n1 3<br>\n</pre>\n<p><b>Explanation :</b>\n<p>\nIn the first test case there are 5 people standing in a circle.<br> 1 kills 2 and handsover the sword to 3.<br> Then 3 kills 4 and handsover the sword to 5. <br>5 kills 1 and handsover the sword to 3<br>Now only 3 and 5 are remaining and 3 has the sword so he wont kill 5.<br>Hence Shah will stand at position 3 and Rukh at position 5\n\n",
