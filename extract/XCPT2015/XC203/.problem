As per the available documents and maps of the plot there were mines planted on that land during war with their locations marked on the map. Now these have to be removed but the problem is that there is no proper idea of the range of the mines. They have to be defused as per a set of old rules step by step but with only one rule implemented in a step as mentioned below in order:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Any live mine with fewer than two live neighbours is defused by the bomb squad without any danger.</li>\n<li>Any live mine with more than three live neighbours is automatically defused due to overcrowded connections.</li>\n<li>Any live mine with two or three live neighbours stays as it was, unchanged, to the next level.</li>\n<li>Any defused mine with exactly three live neighbours becomes a an explosion prone area.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>\n\u2018X\u2019 \u2013 Live Mine \t\u2018.\u2019 \u2013 Defused Mine/ Safe Point<br /><br />\nThe neighbours of a mine are those which immediately surround it.<br />\nThe plot is represented by a 2D square matrix. You have to tell after \u2018N\u2019 steps what would be the state of the plot.\n</p>\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>First line contains an integer <b>T</b> which is the no. of test cases, followed by <b>T</b> test cases.<br />\nEach test case has <b>W</b> the size of the plot in the first line followed by <b>N</b> the number of steps. This is followed by the number of mines <b>G</b> further followed by <b>G</b> different coordinates of the position of mine (each pair separated in a different line).\n</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>For each combination output a 2D matrix representing the plot of land in its new state (as per the symbols used in the examples).</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>T</b> \u2264 <b>100</b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>W</b> \u2264 <b>100</b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>N</b> \u2264 <b>1500</b></li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<p><b>Input:</b><br />\n<br /><br />\n1<br /><br />\n7<br /><br />\n1<br /><br />\n3<br /><br />\n3<br /><br />\n2<br /><br />\n3<br /><br />\n3<br /><br />\n3<br /><br />\n4<br /></p>\n<pre><br />\n<b>Output:</b>\n.......\n.......\n...X...\n...X...\n...X...\n.......\n.......\n</pre>",
