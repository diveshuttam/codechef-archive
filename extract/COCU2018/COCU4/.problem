He takes packages of chapati for food. Each package has K chapatis. On the i<sup>th</sup> day, he eats A<sub>i</sub> pieces of chapati. Unfortunately, Yash, as we know, is very lazy, always forgets to close the package of chapatis, so each day the last piece of chapati becomes exposed to mold (a fungus), and is no longer suitable for eating and is thrown away.</p>\n\n<p>Suppose if K = 4 and N = 3, then A = {3, 1, 2}, Yash has packages of chapati each having 4 pieces of chapati, and his travel lasts 3 days. On the first day, he must eat 3 chapatis. So he opens a new package of chapati and eats 3 of them. He forgets to close the package, so the 4th one becomes bad.The next day, he wants to eat 1 chapati. In the first package he doesn't have any good chapati left, so he opens a new package of chapati and eats one piece from that. On the 3rd day, he wants to eat 2 chapatis. In the second package, he has three pieces, one of them is bad; so he has 2 good pieces. He eats 2 from this package. So he must buy 2 packages of chapatis.</p>\n\n<p>Please help Yash in finding out the minimum number of packages of chapatis he should take on the tour.</p></p>\n\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The first line of input contains a single integer <b>T</b> denoting the number of test cases</li>\n<li>The first line of each test contains two space separated integers N and K.</li>\n<li>The next line of each test case contains N space separated integers denoting the number of chapatis Yash wants to eat each day.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>For each of the T test cases, output a single line - minimum number of packages of chapati Yash should take.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>N</b> \u2264 <b>10^5</b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>K</b> \u2264 <b>10^11</b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>A</b><sub>i</sub> \u2264 <b>10^6</b></li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n3\n3 4\n3 1 2\n1 1\n1\n2 4\n8 8\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n2\n1\n4\n</pre>",
