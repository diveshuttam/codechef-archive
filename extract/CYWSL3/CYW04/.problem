Of these one method is the replacement cipher text generation method. In this each character is replaced by a particular other character and the text is modified. Write a program to display a text box on the screen and every input character given by the user should be displayed as \u2018*\u2019 mark. The program should meet the following constraint\nThe working of enter, backspace should be as usual.\nAfter pressing enter, the password is encrypted using replacement cipher text generating and saved in the file named \u201cpass.txt\u201d.\n*********\n\n<h3>Example</h3>\n\n<pre>\n<b>Input</b>\nabcdefghi\n\n<b>Output:</b>\nbcdefghij\n</pre></p>",
