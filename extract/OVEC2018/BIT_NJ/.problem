The forest had\u00a0<strong>N</strong> trees indexed from <strong>1\u00a0</strong>to\u00a0<strong>N</strong>\u00a0each of which has some\u00a0amount of Chakra in it.</p>\n<p>The amount of chakra in the\u00a0<strong>i<sup>th</sup></strong> tree is the number of fibonacci numbers which are less than the\u00a0<strong>i</strong><sup><strong>th</strong></sup> fibonacci number and are\u00a0<a title=\"Coprime\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coprime_integers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">coprime</a>\u00a0to the\u00a0<strong>i</strong><sup><strong>th</strong></sup> fibonacci number. Fibonacci numbers are defined as :-<br /> <strong>F</strong><sub><strong>1</strong></sub> =\u00a0<strong>1</strong>,<br /><strong>F<sub>2</sub>\u00a0=\u00a01\u00a0</strong>and<br /><strong>F<sub>i</sub> =\u00a0F<sub>i-1</sub></strong> +\u00a0<strong>F<sub>i-2</sub></strong> <strong>\u2200</strong>\u00a0<strong>i\u00a0\u2265 3</strong>.<br />For example, the 1st 5 fibonacci numbers are <strong>1</strong>, <strong>1</strong>, <strong>2</strong>, <strong>3</strong>, <strong>5</strong>, so strength of the first <strong>5</strong> trees are as follows :-<br />Amount of Chakra of <strong>1<sup>st</sup></strong> Tree = <strong>0</strong> as there are no fibonaccci numbers less than 1,<br />Amount of Chakra of <strong>2<sup>nd</sup></strong> Tree = <strong>0</strong> as there are no fibonaccci numbers less than 1,<br />Amount of Chakra of <strong>3<sup>rd</sup></strong> Tree = <strong>2</strong> as the 1st 2 fibonacci numbers 1 and 1 are less than the 3rd fibonacci number and also coprime to the 3rd fibonacci number,<br />Amount of Chakra of <strong>4<sup>th</sup></strong> Tree = <strong>3</strong> as the\u00a01st 3 fibonacci numbers 1, 1 and 2 are less than the 4th fibonacci number and also coprime to the 4th fibonacci number and<br />Amount of Chakra of <strong>5<sup>th</sup></strong> Tree = <strong>4</strong> as the\u00a01st 4 fibonacci numbers 1, 1, 2 and 3 are less than the 5th fibonacci number and also coprime to the 5th fibonacci number.</p>\n<p>There is a connection between each pair of trees that have the same amount of chakra. For example, say consider any\u00a0<strong>5\u00a0</strong>trees named <strong>a</strong>, <strong>b</strong>,\u00a0<strong>c</strong>, <strong>d</strong> and <strong>e</strong>, with the following amount of chakra\u00a05, 5, 6, 5 and 6 respectively, then there are following connections :-<br />between trees\u00a0<strong>a</strong> and\u00a0<strong>b</strong>,\u00a0between trees\u00a0<strong>a</strong> and <strong>d</strong>, between trees <strong>b</strong>\u00a0and <strong>d </strong>and\u00a0between trees\u00a0<strong>c</strong> and <strong>e.</strong>\u00a0</p>\n<p>In the training, Jiraiya asked Naruto to destroy all existing connections between the trees. Now before Naruto starts destroying the connections with his Rasengan, he wants to know the number of existing connections. So, given the number of trees, calculate the number of connections that Naruto has to destroy.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The first line of the input contains a single integer <strong>T</strong> denoting the number of test cases. The description of <strong>T</strong> test cases follows.<br />Each test case consists of a single line of input consisting of a single integer\u00a0<strong>N</strong> denoting the number of trees.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>For each test case, output a single integer on a new line denoting the answer to the problem.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>1\u00a0\u2264\u00a0</strong><strong>T\u00a0\u2264 10<sup>6</sup></strong></li>\n<li><strong>1\u00a0\u2264\u00a0</strong><strong>N\u00a0\u2264 10<sup>6</sup></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Information to Score Partial Points</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>For 5% of the score, it is guaranteed that <strong>T</strong>,<strong>N\u00a0</strong>\u2264 10.</li>\n<li>For further 5% of the score, it is guaranteed that <strong>T</strong>,<strong>N\u00a0</strong>\u2264 100.</li>\n<li>For further 15% of the score, it is guaranteed that <strong>T</strong>,<strong>N\u00a0</strong>\u2264 5000.</li>\n<li>For the rest of the 75% of the score, no extra guarantees. That is, <strong>T</strong>,<strong>N\u00a0</strong>\u2264 10<sup>6</sup>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><strong>Input:</strong>\n3<br />1<br />6<br />8\n\n<strong>Output:</strong>\n0<br />2<br />3</pre>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p>The number of connections for a single tree is 0, for 6 trees is 2 and for 8 trees is 3.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>",
