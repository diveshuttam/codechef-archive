Their wives Hinata and Sakura respectively presented them with various games but all left them cold.<br />So, they (Hinata and Sakura) decided to create a new game...</p>\n<p>They defined Game <strong>G</strong>, with following tuples:<br /><strong>S</strong>: Set of all possible states that the game could be in.<br /><strong>W</strong>: Set of winning states (Subset of <strong>S</strong>).<br /><strong>M</strong>: Set of moves. Each move is given by an unordered pair(<strong>A</strong>, <strong>B</strong>), where <strong>A</strong> &amp; <strong>B</strong> belong to <strong>S</strong>, defines the valid transition between two states <strong>A</strong> and <strong>B </strong>i.e.&nbsp;a player can make a single move to transform the game from state <strong>A</strong> to state <strong>B</strong> and vice-versa.<br /> <strong>G</strong> can be transformed from a non-winning state (a state in <strong>S</strong>-<strong>W&nbsp;</strong>i.e. the set of all possible states that are in&nbsp;<strong>S</strong> but not in&nbsp;<strong>W</strong>) to a winning state (a state in <strong>W</strong>) by applying a sequence of moves.<br /> And in this process the player making the last move wins.<br /> <br /> <strong>Legal moves</strong> are those which can be used in the sequence of moves while transforming <strong>G</strong> from a non-winning state to a winning state.<br /> Illegal moves are those which can never be used for transforming <strong>G</strong> from non-winning state to winning state.<br /> For example, consider G: where S={1,2,3,4,5} , W={1}, M={(1,2),(2,3),(1,3),(4,5)}<br /> Here (1,2), (2,3) and (1,3) are legal moves as they can be used in transforming G from states 2 and 3 to state 1 as follows :- 2-&gt;1 or 2-&gt;3-&gt;1 or 3-&gt;1.<br /> However (4,5) is illegal as it can never be used for transforming G from any state to 1.<br />The game can start at any of non-winning state(any state in S-W).</p>\n<p>But when this game is presented to Naruto and Sasuke, instead of playing it, they thought that there are too many moves and hence it will only be a waste of time playing this game.<br />So they decided to add restrictions to the move set.</p>\n<p>A <strong>restriction</strong> is made by banning a legal move i.e. they can pick a <strong>legal move</strong> from M and remove it from M.</p>\n<p>Note: Imposing restriction may cause some other move to become illegal.<br /> For example, consider G, where S={1,2,3,4,5} , W={1}, M={(1,2),(2,3),(4,5)}<br /> Initially (2,3) is legal but once (1,2) is removed then (2,3) becomes illegal.<br /> Also, note that they can't remove (4,5) as it's already illegal.</p>\n<p><strong>Restrictions</strong> are imposed in the following way :-</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Both Naruto and Sasuke take chance alternating, starting with Naruto.</li>\n<li>In each chance, they impose a restriction of their choice.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Eventually, they found out that they can make <strong>G</strong> a <strong>NO WINNER</strong> game, i.e. a game in which&nbsp;no player is able to win the game irrespective of any starting state (G can never be transformed from a state in <strong>S</strong>-<strong>W</strong> to a state in <strong>W</strong> with remaining moves in <strong>M</strong>).&nbsp;In other words, <strong>G</strong> is a <strong>NO WINNER</strong> game if <strong>M</strong> does not contain any legal move.&nbsp;They found it interesting and suddenly developed a race to make <strong>G&nbsp;</strong>a <strong>NO WINNER</strong> game. The first person to make <strong>G</strong> a <strong>NO WINNER</strong> game wins the race. But they got so carried away that their wives are now worried.</p>\n<p>The only way to end this race is that you predetermine the winner of the race. Can you help them in this task ?</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The first line of input contains a single integer&nbsp;<strong>T</strong> denoting the number of test cases. The description of&nbsp;<strong>T</strong> test cases follow.&nbsp;Each describes a scenario for <strong>G</strong> through <strong>S</strong>, <strong>W</strong>, and <strong>M</strong>.<br />The first line contains two space separated integers <strong>P&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong>Q&nbsp;</strong>denoting&nbsp;the total number of possible states (cardinality of <strong>S)</strong> and the total number of moves (cardinality of <strong>M</strong>) respectively.<br />(The elements in <strong>S</strong> are numbered from <strong>1</strong> to <strong>P</strong>)<br />Each of the next&nbsp;<strong>Q</strong> lines contain two space-separated integers <strong>A</strong> and <strong>B</strong>&nbsp;describing a possible move from state <strong>A</strong> to state&nbsp;<strong>B</strong> and vice-versa (i.e. (<strong>A</strong>,<strong>B</strong>) belongs to the set <strong>M</strong>)<br />Next line contains single integer <strong>R </strong>denoting&nbsp;the number of winning states (cardinality of <strong>W</strong>).<br />The last line contains <strong>R</strong> space-separated integers representing the elements of <strong>W</strong>.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Note</h3>\n<p>You can assume that there is no move between two winning states, or formally, there is no element (<strong>A</strong>,<strong>B</strong>) present in <strong>M</strong> such that both <strong>A</strong> and <strong>B</strong> belong to <strong>W</strong>.<br /> All the moves in <strong>M</strong> are unique and define transitions between two different states.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>For each test case (i.e. each game), you have to determine the winner of the race considering that both of Naruto and Sasuke play optimally.&nbsp;If Naruto wins, then you have to print '<strong>naruto</strong>' without quotes and if&nbsp;Sasuke wins, then you have to print '<strong>sasuke</strong>' without quotes.&nbsp;For each test case print the answer on a new line.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>1</strong> &le; <strong>T</strong> &le; <strong>50</strong></li>\n<li><strong>2</strong> &le; <strong>P</strong> &le; <strong>10<sup>5</sup></strong></li>\n<li><strong>1</strong> &le; <strong>Q</strong>&nbsp;&le; <strong>10<sup>5</sup></strong></li>\n<li><strong>1</strong> &le; <strong>A</strong>,<strong>B</strong>&nbsp;&le; <strong>P</strong></li>\n<li><strong><strong>1</strong> </strong>&le;<strong> <strong>R</strong>&nbsp;</strong>&lt;<strong> P</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Information to Score Partial Points</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>For 20% of the score, it is guaranteed that <strong>P&nbsp;</strong>&le; 10, <strong>Q&nbsp;</strong>&le; 15.</li>\n<li>For the rest of the 80% of the score, no extra guarantees.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><strong>Input:</strong></pre>\n<p>3<br />4 3<br />1 2<br />2 3<br />3 4<br />1<br />1<br />3 2<br />1 2<br />1 3<br />1<br />1<br />4 4<br />1 3<br />2 3<br />3 4<br />2 4<br />2<br />1 2</p>\n<pre><strong>Output:</strong>\nnaruto<br />sasuke<br />sasuke\n</pre>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p><strong>Example case 1.</strong>&nbsp;In the first test case, we have S-W = {2,3,4} and M={(1,2), (2,3), (3,4)}.&nbsp;So the game G can start with states 2 or 3 or 4.&nbsp;If Naruto removes (1,2) from M, then clearly no player can win G irrespective of whether the G starts with states 2 or 3 or 4,&nbsp;as this is the only move to reach winning state 1.Hence this move makes G - a NO WINNER game and Naruto wins the race.<br />In the second test case, we have S-W = {2,3} and M={(1,2), (1,3)}.&nbsp;So the game G can start with states 2 or 3.&nbsp;If Naruto removes (1,2) first, then M becomes {(1,3)}.&nbsp;Now, no player wins if G starts with 2, but if G starts with 3, then a player can make a move (1,3), to transform G from state 3 to state 1 and hence winning the game, thus G is currently not a NO WINNER game.&nbsp;Hence Sasuke takes next chance and removes (1,3) making M={}, hence there are no moves to take in G and thus if G start in S-W, it can never be transformed to a state in W(as there are no moves to take), thus G becomes NO WINNER game. Hence Sasuke wins the race.&nbsp;A similar analysis applies if Naruto removes (1,3) first from M.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
