    "body": "<span class=\"solution-visible-txt\">All submissions for this problem are available.</span><p>Two strings can be shuffled by interspersing their letters to form a new string, much like two piles of cards can be shuffled to form a single pile.</p>\n<p>For example, the strings HELLO and WORLD can be shuffled to form HWEOLRLLOD, or HEWORLLLDO, or perhaps simply HELLOWORLD. It is not a shuffle if the original order of letters is not preserved. For example, the D in WORLD cannot ever appear before the R after being shuffled. This means that EHLLOWRDLO, for instance, is not a shuffle of HELLO and WORLD, even though it contains all the original letters. A string is a shuffle of twins if it can be formed by shuffling two identical strings.</p>\n<p>For example, ABACBDECDE is a shuffle of twins because it can be formed by shuffling ABCDE and ABCDE. DBEACBCADE is not a shuffle of twins because it cannot be formed by shuffling two identical strings.<br />\nAll the strings will contains only UPPERCASE letters.</p>\n<p>In case, no twins exist output \u201cTwins don\u2019t exist\u201d (quotes only for clarity).</p>\n<p>All strings will contain only UPPERCASE letters.</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The first line of the input will is integer T denoting the number of testcases.</p>\n<p>Next T lines contain the shuffled string <b>S. The input string can contain upto N letters.</b></p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>For every testcase, output a single line containing one of the two identical strings that make up the input string.</p>\n<p>If the no such pair of identical strings exist, print \"Twins don't exist\". (quotes only for clarity).</p>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<p>1 &lt;= T &lt;= 10</p>\n<p>2 &lt;= N &lt;= 10<sup>6</sup></p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre>\n<b>Input:</b>\n2\nABACBDECDE\nDBEACBCADE\n\n<b>Output:</b>\nABCDE\nTwins don't exist\n</pre>",
