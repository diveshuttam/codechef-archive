One by one, all the dwarves entered Bilbo\u2019s house and Thorin and his band of dwarves took their places.</p>\n<p>Bilbo, for one, was as confused as one could be as to what was going on. There were so many dwarves in his house, singing songs about reclaiming the lonely mountain and helping themselves with all the food in his house. Anyone else would probably have lost their cool and asked the uninvited guests to leave but not Bilbo. He had always been a brilliant host and it was going to stay that way.<br />\nHe decided to help but he\u2019d be smart about it. Bilbo figured that he\u2019d have to clean up on his own afterwards, so he came up with a scheme that would allow him to use very few glasses. Since everyone could not fit at the table at once, they had supper in turns and the once a dwarf completed his supper and went out, his glass was available to be used by a new dwarf entering the room.</p>\n<p>Bilbo marked the time at which each person sat down to eat and got up. Now, assuming that there\u2019s no time lag between a person getting up from the table another taking his place and assuming that the glass can also be used by the other person right away, what is the minimum number of glasses that Bilbo should set at the table so that everyone can have their supper.</p>\n<p>Let \u2018n\u2019 be the total number of uninvited dwarfs and let \u2018s\u2019 and \u2018t\u2019 be the starting and finishing time respectively for each one of them, then output the minimum number of glasses at the table that would do the job.</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The first line of the input contains an integer t denoting the number of testcases.</p>\n<p>Every testcase consists of the following lines:<br />\nThe first line contains an integer n denoting the number of uninvited dwarfs.</p>\n<p>The next n lines contain two space separated integers denoting the starting time s and finishing time f respectively.</p>\n<p><b>NOTE: s will always be smaller than f</b></p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>For every testcase output a single line containing an integer denoting the minimum number of glasses required.</p>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<p>1 &lt;= t &lt;= 5</p>\n<p>1 &lt;= n &lt;= 1000000</p>\n<p>1 &lt;= s, f &lt;= 10^18</p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre>\n<b>Input:</b>\n1\n7\n1830 1925\n1920 2000\n1915 1950\n1845 1930\n1850 1855\n1800 1900\n1905 1945\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n5\n</pre>",
