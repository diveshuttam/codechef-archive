Each cube has either the letter 'A' or 'B' inscribed on it.<br /><br /></p>\n<p>Now Rob wants to swap any two positions of cubes placed on the line, such that the there exists a sequence of continuous cubes with letter 'A' inscribed on them, whose number is greater than or equal to M.<br /><br /></p>\n<p>However, mechanically swapping cubes is a tedious task. Therefore he wishes to know the minimum number of swap operations he has to perform to get such an arrangement of cubes.<br /></p>\n<h3>Input Format</h3>\n<p>First line consists of T test cases.<br /><br />\nFor each test case, first line consists of the string S, composed of A's and B's, representing the initial configuration of cubes, and second line an integer M.<br /><br /></p>\n<h3>Output Format</h3>\n<p>The output consists of T lines corresponding to T test cases, such that it is the minimum number of operations required to create a consecutive segment of greater than M A\u2019s from S. <br /><br /></p>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>1 \u2264 Sum of lengths of S over all test cases \u2264 10<sup>6</sup><br />\n</li><li>1 \u2264 Length(S) \u2264 10<sup>5</sup></li>\n<li> It is ensured that number of A's are >= M.\n</li></ul>\n<p><br /></p>\n<h3>Sample Input</h3>\n<p>1<br /><br />\nABA<br /><br />\n2<br /><br /></p>\n<h3>Sample Output</h3>\n<p>1<br /></p>\n",
