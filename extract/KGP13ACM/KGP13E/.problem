    "body": "<span class=\"solution-visible-txt\">All submissions for this problem are available.</span><p>A city has a road network with all roads arranged in a <b>K</b> x <b>K</b> square grid, with intersections \u00a0(total (<b>K</b>+1) x (<b>K</b>+1)) numbered as shown below (for an example 4 x 4 grid).</p>\n<div align=center>\n<img width=\"200px\" src=\"//www.codechef.com/download/grid_kgp.png\" />\n</div>\n<p>There are no one-way roads in the city now. For ease of movement of cars, the traffic department plans to convert all roads to one-way, while ensuring that any intersection can be reached from any other intersection. However, the fire brigade is located beside intersection <b>A</b>, and a set of factories with high fire risks are located in a set of intersections <b>J</b>. It is known that no intersection in <b>J</b> can be reached from <b>A</b> without making a turn somewhere, irrespective of which roads are made one-way or the route followed. The fire brigade has requested the traffic department to convert the roads to one-way in such a manner such that fire trucks starting from <b>A</b> can reach all of the intersections in <b>J</b> passing through the minimum total number of intersections possible to avoid delay. How should the traffic department decide which road to set which way?</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The first line contains the number of test cases <b>N</b>.</p>\n<p>For each test case, the first line contains <b>K</b>, the dimension of the grid. The second line contains the intersection number <b>A </b>(an integer indicating the intersection number in the numbering scheme shown). The third line contains the number of elements in <b>J</b>, followed by the intersection numbers of the elements in <b>J</b>.</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>For each test case, in the first line, print the case number, followed by a colon, followed by a single space, followed by the total number of intersections passed to reach all elements of <b>J</b> from <b>A</b>, <b>not counting intersection A or the intersections in J</b>. Then print 2<b>K</b>(<b>K</b>+1) line, one for each possible edge in the grid. Each of these lines should contain (in this order): an integer <b>x</b>, an integer <b>y</b>, and an integer <b>d</b> from the set {0,1} where <b>x</b> and <b>y</b> are valid intersection numbers, and <b>d</b>=0 if the one-way is set from <b>x</b> to <b>y</b> or <b>d</b>=1 if it is set from <b>y</b> to <b>x</b>. The two nodes in an edge can be printed in any order as long as the correct d is printed. Similarly, the edges can be printed in any order.</p>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<p>0 &lt; <b>N</b> \u2264 3</p>\n<p>1 &lt; <b>K</b> \u2264 100</p>\n<p>1 \u2264 |<b>J</b>| \u2264 <b>K</b><sup>2</sup> (|<b>J</b>| integers indicating the intersection numbers in the numbering scheme shown)</p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n1\n2\n4\n2 6 2\n\n<b>Output:</b>\nCase 1: 2\n0 1 1\n4 5 0\n2 1 1\n6 7 1\n1 4 1\n2 5 0\n3 4 0\n7 4 1\n0 3 0\n5 8 0\n3 6 1\n7 8 1\n\n</pre>",
