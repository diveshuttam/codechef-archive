They have <b>k</b> packets of cigarettes each having<br />\na[k] cigarettes each. Also, a[i]=i-1 for 1&lt;=i&lt;=k. Now they decide to divide the packets within themselves.To do so<br />\nthey arrange all packets in increasing order of the number of cigarettes they contain. Starting from the first packet,<br />\nthey label the packets 1, 2 and 3 in order repeatedly so that label of packet containing<br />\n0 cigarettes is 1, 1 cigarette is 2, 2 cigarettes is 3, 3 cigarettes is 1, 4 cigarettes is 2 and so on.<br />\nTo make the labels unique, they take packets with same label and repeat the above process so labels of packets having<br />\n0 cigarette is 11, 1 cigarettes is 21, 2 cigarettes is 31, 3 cigarettes is 12, 4 cigarettes is 22 and so on.<br />\nThis process is repeated until all packets have a unique label.<br />\nAll packets having labels starting with the same number belong to the same person.<br />\nNow one day, Athos and Porthos smoke a lot when Aramis was with his girlfriend. When Aramis returns to his home<br />\nhe finds only two packets. He recognises one of the packets with <b>n</b> cigarettes definitely belonging to him but<br />\nits label is lost. The other packet has label <b>m</b> on it but Aramis doesn't know amything else about it.<br />\nAs Aramis is not so bright, he needs you to figure out the total number of cigarettes left that belong to him.<br />\nAssume that k tends to infinity<br />\n</p>\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The first line of input contains an integer <b>T</b>, the number of test cases. Then <b>T </b>lines follows, each line<br />\ncontaining two integers <b>m</b> and <b>n</b> as mentioned above.<br /><br />\nThe leading 1s in <b>m</b> are omitted (e.g. 22111... is denoted as 22) since <b>k</b> tends to infinity.</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>Output a separate line for each test case containing the answer. </p>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<p>1&lt;=T&lt;=500<br /><br />\n1&lt;=m&lt;=10<sup>9</sup><br /><br />\n1&lt;=n&lt;=(10<sup>10000</sup>+500)<br /></p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n3\n22 1\n2 100\n12 100\n<b>Output:</b>\n5\n101\n100\n</pre>\n<h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p><b>Example case 1:</b> <br /><br />\nPacket containing 1 cigarette definitely belongs to Aramis which has label 211.. . So label 211.. belongs to him. So all packets with<br />\nlabels starting with 2 should belong to him. Hence 2211.. belongs to him. Now 2211.. has 4 cigarettes and 21.. has 1 so he has total<br />\n1+4=5 cigarettes.\n</p>\n",
