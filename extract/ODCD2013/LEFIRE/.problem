The cities here are all on one side of a national highway which is a<br />\nstraight line from one end of the country to another. Byteland being very different from other countries, the<br />\nfire here captures the whole city at once and then spreads throughout the country in a linear fashion. There is one more property of the fire, that it increases its span by the amount equal to sum of its previous two increases. You can assume the fire takes no time in capturing a city.<br /><br />\nThe fire brigade in Byteland now has a huge problem to cater , i.e. to have its station at such locations that it could extinguish the fire as early as possible. There can be at most <b>K</b> fire brigade mobiles in the country and each fire brigade mobile can extinguish at most <b>N</b> number of cities. The fire was initially at city <b>C<sub>1</sub></b> and has spread to city <b>C<sub>2</sub> </b>till the fire brigade comes into action. It takes<b> Q</b> units of time for the fire to spread to adjacent cities. Each fire brigade mobile takes <b> R</b> time to extinguish fire in a city. Assume that no time is taken in travelling from one city to another and only one fire brigade mobile can extinguish fire in a city. Your job is to tell the minimum amount of time that the fire brigade will take to extinguish all the fire.<br /><br />\n<b>Tip :</b> Fast I/O is recommended</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The first line of input contains an integer <b>T</b>, the number of test cases. Then <b>T </b>lines follows, each line<br />\ncontaining four space separated integers<b> N K Q R</b>, where <b>N</b> is the number of cities a single fire brigade<br />\nmobile can extinguish,<b> K</b> is total number of fire brigade mobiles, <b>Q</b> is the amount of time fire takes to spread,<b>R</b> is the time each mobile takes to extinguish fire.</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>Output a separate line for each test case containing single integer representing the minimum amount of time<br />\nit will take to extinguish all fire. If it is not possible to extinguish all the fire then output -1.</p>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<p><b>T</b> =100000<br /><br />\n1&lt;<b>N,K,Q,R</b>&lt;70000</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n3\n1 4 2 1\n1 4 2 2\n2 4 2 3\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n1\n2\n-1\n</pre><p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p><b>Example case 2:</b> Each fire brigade mobile has just enough water to extinguish one city, there are 4 fire brigade mobiles in the country, the time fire takes to spread is 2 units and the time taken to extinguish fire is also 2 units. So, 2 mobiles can initially be used to extinguish fire in city C<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>2</sub> and they will extinguish it just in time before it could start expanding its span. Hence it takes 2 units of time to extinguish all the fire.</p>\n",
