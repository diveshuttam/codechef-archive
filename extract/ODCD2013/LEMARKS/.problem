From past 2 to 3 years the pattern of evaluation has been made a little interesting. Because now the students can choose the teachers who will evaluate their projects. A big  hall has been setup which has teachers sitting in it. The structure can be thought of as a NxN matrix with teachers in each cell. Shivam being one of the smartest student analyses previous years marking pattern and understands that each teacher is known to give the same marks to every student who comes to them. Moreover each teachers position is also fixed in the room. He is also informed by his seniors that at any stage(Cell(i,j) ) he can only move to Cell(i+1,j) or Cell(i,j+1) . Also Shivam must start from (1,1) and go to (N,N).Assuming the same pattern is followed this year calculate the minimum and maximum which Shivam can score. Let\u2019s see if you can match Shivam's smartness.</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The first line of the input contains an integer <b>T</b> denoting the number of test cases. The description of <b>T</b> test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a single integer <b>N</b>.Then next <b>N</b> lines contain <b>N</b> integers each, every integer is the representation of the Marks(M<sub>i</sub>) each teacher gives. (<b>0</b> being the minimum)</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>For each test case, print the total minimum and maximum marks(out of 100) that Shivam can score.<br />Precise up to 6 digits of decimal.\n</p>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<p>\n0 &lt; T &lt;= 10<br /><br />\n1 &lt; N &lt;= 100<br /><br />\n0 &lt; M<sub>i</sub> &lt;= 100\n</p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n1\n2\n4 5\n2 3\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n3.000000 4.000000\n</pre>",
