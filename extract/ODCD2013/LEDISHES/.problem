He has been given two buckets filled with  dishes .These dishes are either <b>big</b> or <b>small</b>.Chef likes small dishes as he is able to clean them faster<br /><br />\nChef picks one dish at random from each bucket and cleans it up .<b>He is happy  when he spends minimum time to clean the dishes in a particular pass .</b><br /><br />\nChef's boss is very lazy . He asks chef to give him a pair <b>p,k</b> such that he will give chef  <b>p small plates</b> to clean and <b>k large plates</b> to clean which would then be mixed and placed  randomly in the buckets .<br /><br />\nChef is clever and wants to find pairs p,k so that  when picking dishes from the buckets   his chance of getting happy will be equal to his chance of getting sad.<br /><br />\n<b>NOTE : Chef is sad whenever he wont be happy.</b><br /><br />\nGiven an integer n , where n is number of small plates and large plates each the chef can use at max in a pair ,help chef find all such pairs<br /></p>\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The first line of input contains an integer <b>T</b> , the number of test cases.Then <b>T</b> lines follows, each line containing single integer <b>N</b> , where N denotes the number of small and big plates that the chef can use  at max to create pairs.</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>For each test case output  one line containing <b>Case:j</b> where  <b>j</b> is the test case number.<br />\nThen all pairs follow that satisfy the condition for the given value of <b>N</b><br />\nOutput these pairs as <b>p</b> followed by a space and then <b>k</b> where <b>p</b> is number of small plates and <b>k</b> is number of large plates </p>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<p><b>T</b>=10000<br /><br />\n3&lt;=<b>N</b>&lt;=10<sup>9</sup></p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input</b>\n2\n80\n10\n<b>Output</b>\nCase:1\n3 1\n15 6\nCase:2\n3 1\n</pre>\n<h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p><b>Example case 1:</b><br />\nWhen Chef uses pair 3 ,1 he will have three small dishes and 1 big dish .
