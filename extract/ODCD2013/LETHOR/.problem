THOR has been the mastermind behind all the victories and Asgardians have decided to greet their King THOR.<br />\nAs THOR is the very fascinated by increasing numbers. A mega Festival is being organised in Asgard and all the Asgardians would be wearing Asgard jersey,<br />\n which will have a jersey number,<b>A<sub>i</sub></b> on it. As the festival is all about making THOR happy. The Asgardians would always follow 2 simple rules:<br /><br />\n1. They always appear in front of THOR in a presentable manner, i.e. stand in a line. <br /><br />\n2. They always stand in such a way that their jersey numbers,<b>A<sub>i</sub>\u2264A<sub>j</sub></b> for all <b>i\u2264j </b>.<br /><br />\n    The festival has started and the things were going well. But then something strange starts to happen. Asgardians seem to have forgot maths and stand in front on THOR randomly.<br />\nTHOR seeing this randomness gets angry. The level of angriness of THOR could me measured as the number of pairs <b>(A<sub>i</sub>,A<sub>j</sub>)</b> who didn't follow the rule.<br />\nNow THOR could be brought back to normal if he gets as many hammers(his weapon) as his level of angriness.<br />Your task is to tell the number of hammers to be offered to THOR.\n</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>First line contains the number of test cases <b>T</b>.Then <b>T</b> test cases follow.<br />\nEach test case consists of two lines. First line consists of a single integer <b>N</b>, the number of Asgardians in a line.<br />\nSecond line contains space separated integers <b>A<sub>i</sub></b>.</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>For every test case output an integer in a separate line, denoting the hammers offered to THOR.</p>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<p>1 \u2264<b> T </b>\u2264 500<br /><br />\n1 \u2264<b> N </b>\u2264 10000<br /><br />\n0 \u2264<b> A<sub>i</sub></b> \u2264 1000000000</p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input :</b> \n2\n4\n2 3 1 4\n5\n1 5 3 2 4\n\n<b>Output :</b>\n2\n4\n</pre>\n<h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p>\nTest case 1: Pairs (2,1) and (3,1) made THOR angry hence the output is 2.<br /><br />\nTest case 2: Pairs (5,3), (5,2), (5,4) and (3,2) made THOR angry hence the output is 4.</p>\n<p></p>",
