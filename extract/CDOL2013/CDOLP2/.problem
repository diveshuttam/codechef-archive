Each player has a skill value(call it <b>S</b>) which is a positive integer.<br />\n Higher the skill value better the player. All players are standing in a circle in the order 1,2,3...<b>N</b>.<br />\nEach player have a dispute with some players standing next to him. Players standing next to 1 are {2,3,...,<b>N</b>}<br />\nand players standing next to <b>N</b> are {1,2,3,...,<b>N</b>-1}<br />\n<br/>You are given <b>N</b> the numbers of players, the skill value S of every player and <b>D</b> the player's dispute number.<br />\nIf the dispute number of a player is <b>D</b> then he has dispute with <b>D</b> players standing right next to him.<br />\nYou have to form a un-disputed(such that no player in the team has dispute with any other player in the team) team with maximum skill. The skill of a team is the sum of skill values of all the players in the team.\n</br/></p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>\nFirst line will contain the number of test cases <b>T</b>.<br />\nFor each test case the first line will contain <b>N</b>, numbers of players.<br />\nSecond line of the test case will contain skill values(<b>S</b>) of all <b>N</b> players separated by space.<br />\nThird line of the test case will contain the dispute numbers(<b>D</b>) of all <b>N</b> players separated by space.<br />\n<br/>There is no empty line between different test cases.\n</br/></p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>\nFor each test case the output will be an integer in a new line, which will be the maximum skill of any non disputed team in the corresponding test case.\n</p>\n<h3>Input Constrain:</h3>\n<pre>\n1 &lt;= T &lt;= 20\n2 &lt;= N &lt;= 100\n1 &lt;= S &lt;= 1000000 (skill value)\n0 &lt;= D &lt;= N-1 (dispute number)\n</pre><h3>Example:</h3>\n<pre>\n<b>Input:</b>\n3\n4\n4 1 5 3\n1 1 2 0\n3\n2 10 5\n1 1 1\n4\n8 7 4 6\n1 1 1 1\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n7\n10\n13\n\n</pre><p><b>Explanation:</b></p>\n<p>\nIn 1st test case:<br/><br />\n1 has dispute with {2}, 2 has dispute with {3}, 3 has dispute with {4,1} and 4 has dispute with none.<br />\nSo possible non disputed teams can be:<br/><br />\n{1,4} skill=7<br/><br />\n{2,3} skill=4<br/><br />\n{3}   skill=5<br/><br />\nTeams {1}, {2}, {4} are also possible.<br/><br />\nSo maximum skill of any un-disputed team = 7\n</br/></br/></br/></br/></br/></br/></p>\n",
