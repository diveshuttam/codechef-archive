The flow graph <b>G</b> has <b>N</b> vertices numbered from <b>1</b> to <b>N</b>. <b>1</b> is Source and <b>N</b> is Sink.<br />\nThere is no incoming edge into Source and no outgoing edge from Sink. There is either edge (u,v) or (v,u) in <b>G</b>. You are also given the capacity of each edges. Assume all capacities are positive integers.<br />\nYou calculated the maximum flow value in <b>G</b>. Now capacity of exactly one edge is increased by some positive integer value but not more than 1000.<br />\nAnd you found that there was no change in maximum flow.<br />\nNow your task is to find out that how many such edges are present in the graph <b>G</b>.\n</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>\nFirst line will contain two integers <b>N</b> and <b>E</b> separated by space, where N is the number of vertices and<br />\nE is the number of edges.<br />\nNext E lines will contain 3 integers <b>u</b>, <b>v</b> and <b>c</b> separated by space. Which means is that there is an edge from <b>u</b> to <b>v</b> having capacity <b>c</b>.\n</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>\nYou have to output an integer which is the number of edges(one at a time) for which increase in their capacity by not more than 1000 will not lead to increase in maximum flow.\n</p>\n<h3>Input Constrain:</h3>\n<pre>\n2 &lt;= N &lt;= 50\n1 &lt;= E &lt;= Maximum possible edges in graph\nu != v\n1 &lt;= c &lt;= 100000\n\n</pre><h3>Example:</h3>\n<pre>\n<b>Input:</b>\n4 5\n1 2 8\n1 3 10\n2 3 5\n2 4 2\n3 4 3\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n3\n\n</pre><p><b>Explanation:</b></p>\n<p>\nIncreasing the capacity of edge (1,2),(1,3) and (2,3) (INDIVIDUALLY) does not have any effect on maximum flow.\n</p>\n",
