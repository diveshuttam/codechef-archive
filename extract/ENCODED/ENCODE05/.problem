Samya claims that no one can beat him in maths especially when it comes to dealing with numbers. So Samya throws a challenge at Utsav that he will be able to do any computation within a second however difficult it is. Utsav tells him a value of N and asks him to find the <b>smallest number such that it is co-prime to all first N natural numbers,it is a composite number and it is a square free number</b>.Surprisingly Samya really gives the answer within a fraction of a second for whatever N Utsav asks him to do. But Utsav is not so good at Maths.So he wants you to write a program for him so that ha can verify Samyas answer. Let's see if your program can do better than Samya's brain.<p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>1st line contain an integer T denoting the number of test cases.Each test case contains one line,an integer N\n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>T lines each containing a single integer S as the answer\n\n<pre>\n<b>Input:</b>\nInput\n2\n1\n6\n\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n6\n77\n\n<h3>CONSTRAINTS:</h3>\n\n1  <=  T  <= 100000\n1  <=  N  <=46000\n1  <=  S  <= 214783647\n\n</pre>\n\n",
