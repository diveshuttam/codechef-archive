The sample contain exactly N types of virus. Each type is recognised by a unique value(So, N values are necessarily DISTINCT).<br>IEM has also received some statistics forecasting the behaviours of the viruses.This provided mainly three ideas:-<br>\n<b>1.The initial number of each type of viruses,I( in other words, initially all type of viruses have same count ie I )<p>\n2.Information regarding Q days about the behaviour of viruses. For each day, they have given 3 integers X,Y and V which means ALL THE TYPES PRESENT in the sample whose values are in between X and Y(both inclusive) will have an increase in number by value V.<p>\n3.Information about the critical virus at the end of each of Q days. For each day, they provide one integer R which means if all the viruses (generated TILL THE END OF THAT DAY) are sorted, in ascending order of their values, then the virus at position R in the sorted list is termed as \"CRITICAL VIRUS\"(the starting position in the list is '1' ie the list has '1' based indexing)</b>\n<p>Scientists working at IEM need to know the<b> TYPE-VALUE of the critical virus at the end of each day</b>,but as they are too energitic, they cannot wait for Q long days to have the list of critical viruses.So, they are asking you to help them.\n\n\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>\n1st line contains one integer N<br>\n2nd line contains N space separated integers which denote values associated with the types present in the sample(they are distinct)<br>\n3rd line contain I and Q separated by a spoace\nEach of the following Q lines will have exactly 4 integers X,Y,V and R separated by spaces.<br><br>\n(the meanings of N,Q,X,Y,V and R are as described in the problem)\n\n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>Output exactly Q lines corresponding to Q days.Each line should contain an integer denoting the type-value of the critical virus among the viruses generated till the end of that day.\n<p>*NOTE:R has nothing to do with X,Y & V particularly on that day, rather it denotes the position in the whole sorted list of viruses generated upto that day.<br>\ntype-value of a virus is typically the value associated with its type.<br>\ndon't assume N values (defining N different types) initially given are some permutation of the numbers from 1 to N. <br>\nthe types which are not present in the sample, are need not to be considered during updating the sample...\n\n<h3>Example</h3>\n\n<pre>\n<b>Input:</b>\n5\n9 3 5 1 6\n2 3\n3 6 1 1\n1 3 3 11\n5 9 2 20\n\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n1\n3\n6\n\n\n<b>Constraints:</b>\n1<=N<=100000\n1<=type-value<=2*10^9\n1<=Q<=200000\n1<=I<=10000\n1<=X<=Y<=2*10^9\n1<=V<=10000\n1<=R<=total_no_of_viruses_generated_at_that_time\n</pre>\n",
