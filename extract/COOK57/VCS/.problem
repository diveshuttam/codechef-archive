Every change made to the source is tracked, along with who made the change, why they made it, and references to problems fixed, or enhancements introduced, by the change.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tVersion control systems are essential for any form of distributed, collaborative development. Whether it is the history of a wiki page or large software development project, the ability to track each change as it was made, and to reverse changes when necessary can make all the difference between a well managed and controlled process and an uncontrolled \u2018first come, first served\u2019 system. It can also serve as a mechanism for due diligence for software projects.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tIn this problem we'll consider a simplified model of a development project. Let's suppose, that there are <b>N</b> source files in the project. All the source files are distinct and numbered from 1 to <b>N</b>.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tA VCS, that is used for maintaining the project, contains two sequences of source files. The first sequence contains the source files, that are ignored by the VCS. If a source file is not in the first sequence, then it's considered to be unignored. The second sequence contains the source files, that are tracked by the VCS. If a source file is not in the second sequence, then it's considered to be untracked. A source file can either be or not be in any of these two sequences.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tYour task is to calculate two values: the number of source files of the project, that are both tracked and ignored, and the number of source files of the project, that are both untracked and unignored.\n</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The first line of the input contains an integer <b>T</b> denoting the number of test cases. The description of <b>T</b> test cases follows.</p>\n<p>The first line of the test case description contains three integers <b>N</b>, <b>M</b> and <b>K</b> denoting the number of source files in the project, the number of ignored source files and the number of tracked source files.</p>\n<p>The second line contains <b>M</b> distinct integers denoting the sequence <b>A</b> of ignored source files. The sequence is strictly increasing.</p>\n<p>The third line contains <b>K</b> distinct integers denoting the sequence <b>B</b> of tracked source files. The sequence is strictly increasing.</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>For each test case, output a single line containing two integers: the number of the source files, that are both tracked and ignored, and the number of the source files, that are both untracked and unignored.</p>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>1 \u2264 <b>T</b> \u2264 100</li>\n<li>1 \u2264 <b>M</b>, <b>K</b> \u2264 <b>N</b> \u2264 100</li>\n<li>1 \u2264 <b>A<sub>1</sub></b> &lt; <b>A<sub>2</sub></b> &lt; ... &lt; <b>A<sub>M</sub></b> \u2264 <b>N</b></li>\n<li>1 \u2264 <b>B<sub>1</sub></b> &lt; <b>B<sub>2</sub></b> &lt; ... &lt; <b>B<sub>K</sub></b> \u2264 <b>N</b></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n2\n7 4 6\n1 4 6 7\n1 2 3 4 6 7\n4 2 2\n1 4\n3 4\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n4 1\n1 1\n\n</pre><h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p>\n\tIn the first test case, the source files {1, 4, 6, 7} are both tracked and ignored, the source file {5} is both untracked and unignored.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tIn the second test case, the source file {4} is both tracked and ignored, the source file {2} is both untracked and unignored.\n</p>\n",
