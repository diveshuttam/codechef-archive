At the heart of his tactical skills, is the way he has organized his armies, and the way he is able to estimate his soldiers' skill-levels, thus helping him make crucial decisions as to whom to dispatch to which areas of the war.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nHis army is organized in the form of a hierarchy - indeed it is a tree, with him as the root. We say \"<b>A has immediate superior B</b>\" if <b>A</b> reports directly to <b>B</b>. We further say \"<b>A has superior B</b>\" if there is a chain of soldiers starting with <b>A</b>, ending with <b>B</b>, and where each soldier reports directly to the next soldier of the chain. Further, each soldier is assigned an initial <b>skill-level</b> based on prior experience and battle proficiency. \n</p>\n\n<p>\nIn order for Tywin to decide whom to send to which battle, he has the following scheme: He chooses a particular soldier <b>S</b> as the leader of his temporary 'regiment', and sends in to battle, <b>S</b> as well as all the soldiers that have <b>S</b> as one of their superiors. He estimates the skill level of the regiment as the total skill level of all the soldiers under <b>S</b> (denoted by query \"<b>Q S</b>\").\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAfter a battle, he may want to update the skill levels of some soldiers. If he wants to update the skill level of soldier <b>S</b> to value <b>x</b>, it is denoted by the query \"<b>U S x</b>\".\n</p>\n\n<p>\nYou are given the structure of the army, whose size is <b>N</b>, the initial skill levels of all the individual soldiers, as well the number of queries <b>M</b>. For each query of the type \"<b>Q S</b>\", report the sum of skill-levels of all the soldiers who have <b>S</b> as their superior.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n<b>Note:</b> The soldiers are numbered 1 to <b>N</b>, and Tywin is given the number <b>1</b>.\n</p>\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>\nThe first line consists of the integers <b>N</b> and <b>M</b>, denoting the number of soldiers and the number of queries.<br>\nThis is followed by a single line consisting of <b>N</b> nonnegative values - the <b>skill levels of the N soldiers</b>.<br>\nThis is then followed by <b>N-1</b> lines consisting of pairs of integers <b>(u, v)</b>, denoting that either <b>u is an immediate superior of v, or vice-versa</b>.<br>\nFinally you are given the <b>M</b> queries, of either the form \"<b>U S x</b>\" or \"<b>Q S</b>\".</p>\n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>\nFor each \"<b>Q S</b>\" query, output the sum of skill values of all the soldiers under <b>S</b>.\n</p>\n\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li> <b>1</b> \u2264 <b>N</b> \u2264 <b>10<sup>5</sup></b> </li>\n<li> <b>1</b> \u2264 <b>M</b> \u2264 <b>10<sup>5</sup></b> </li>\n<li> All skill values given with be in the range [<b>0</b>, <b>20,000</b>] </li>\n<li> <b>1</b> \u2264 <b>S</b> \u2264 <b>N</b> for all queries </li>\n<li> All soldiers will have soldier <b>1</b> (Tywin) as their superior </li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre>\n<b>Input:</b>\n5 8\n7 2 0 5 8\n1 2\n2 3\n2 4\n1 5\nQ 1\nQ 2\nU 2 4\nQ 1\nQ 2\nU 5 3\nQ 1\nQ 2\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n22\n7\n24\n9\n19\n9\n</pre>\n",
