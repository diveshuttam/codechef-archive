He sees colors as a combination of red, blue and green. To be more precise, each color is represented by three integral indices (R,B,G). </p>\n<p>For example, (0,0,1) and (0,1,1) represent two different colors.</p>\n<p>The range of values of R, B, G is from 0 to K(inclusive). The value of K depends on the planet C3PO is currently on.</p>\n<p>C3PO likes a certain type of colors called Special Colors. We will consider a color to be special if and only if all pairs of its indices differ by no more than V.</p>\n<p>For example, in a system with K = 2 and V = 1, the color (2, 1, 1) is special, because its red and blue components differ by 1, its red and green components differ by 1, and its green and blue components differ by 0, and none of these differences exceeds 1.</p>\n<p>But (2, 1, 0) is not special, because the red and green components differ by more than 1.</p>\n<p>Your task is to find the possible no. of special colors for a given planet(value of K,V). Go on, help C3PO.</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, T. T lines follow. Each contains two space-separated integers K and V.</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>For each test case, output one line containing \"Case #x: y\", where x is the test case number (starting from 1) and y is the number of distinct special colors.</p>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b>0</b> \u2264 <b>K</b> \u2264 <b>2555</b></li>\n<li><b>0</b> \u2264 <b>V</b> \u2264 <b>555</b></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n2\n1 1\n1 0\n\n<b>Output:</b>\nCase #1: 8\nCase #2: 2\n</pre><h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p><b>Example case 2:</b>only (0,0,0) and (1,1,1) satisfy the required conditions.</p>\n",
