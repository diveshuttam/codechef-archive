Zeus asked him to keep track of the mutations and answer the current text in the string whenever asked. <br/><br/>\n\nZeus wanted Rubixius to answer if any of these conditions held true. The conditions are prioritized with the first having highest priority.<br/><br/>\n1. Only answer if the string has changed.<br/>\n2. To check if Rubixius was paying attention he had to answer the correct text after every <b>K</b> magic queries when Zeus did not ask him the answer.<br/>\n3. Rubixius had to tell Zeus the last state of the string.<br/><br/>\nRubixius mastered this game. Can you?\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The first line will contain an integer T<50 with the number of Test Cases. Each case will start with a string S on a line. The following line contains 2 integers N and K where N is the number of queries and K is the query count after which Rubixius should automatically answer. Then N lines follow with 1 query/line. <br/><br/>\n\n<table borders=\"all\" width=\"520\">\n<tr>\n<th width=\"20%\">Magic Query</th>\n<th width=\"80%\">Description</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>IZA i str</td>\n<td>Insert string <b>str</b> at position <b>i</b></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>DZA i j</td>\n<td>Delete substring starting from i upto j</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>RZA i j str</td>\n<td>Replace substring starting from i upto j with str</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>WZA i j k</td>\n<td>Remove substring starting from i upto j and place it at k</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>KZA i j a b</td>\n<td>Swap substring starting from i upto j with substring starting from a upto b</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<br/>A query starting with <b>P</b> means Zeus wants Rubixius to answer.<br/>\n<b>Constraints</b><br/>\nIn the queries if j>string length, then take j to be the last index.<br/>\ni<=string length<br/>\nString length will always be less than 100.<br/>\nString will be alphanumeric.<br/>\nN,K<1000<br/>\n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>Output the text on a new line every time you need to.\n\n<h3>Example</h3>\n\n<pre>\n<b>Input:</b>\n1\nstringmagiciseasy\n6 2\nIZA 13 not\nRZA 13 16 notvery\nPDZA 13 20\nWZA 5 12 0\nDZA 7 7\nDZA 7 13\n\n<b>Output:</b>\nstringmagicisnotveryeasy\nstringmagiciseasy\nmagiciseasy\n\n</pre>\n",
