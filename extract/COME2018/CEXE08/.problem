At the beginning of the game, Kaneki picks two numbers $a$ and $b$, and Hide picks two numbers $c$ and $d$. Initially, two numbers, **1000 and 7**, are written on a blackboard (these numbers will always be the first two numbers on the board). When it\u2019s Kaneki\u2019s turn, he calculates $ax+by$, where $x$ is the last number written on the board and $y$ is the second-last number written on the board, and writes this value on the board. Similarly, when it\u2019s Hide\u2019s turn, he calculates $cx+dy$, where $x$ and $y$ have the same meanings as above, and writes this value on the board.\n\nFormally, if $f(n)$ denotes the $n^{th}$ number written on the board, initially $f(1)=1000$ and $f(2)=7$. If Kaneki is writing the $n^{th}$ number on the board, then $f(n) = a \\times f(n-1)+b \\times f(n-2)$. Else, if Hide is writing the $n^{th}$ number on the board, then $f(n) = c \\times f(n-1)+d \\times f(n-2)$. Note that when the game starts, Kaneki would be writing the $3^{rd}$ number on the board.\n\nYou, a programmer, have come across these two friends playing this game, and you wonder: given $a$, $b$, $c$, $d$, what will be the $n^{th}$ number written on the board? Note that since the blackboard is of limited size, the friends have agreed to write all numbers modulo $10^9+7$.\n\n###Input:\n\n- First line will contain $t$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. \n- Each testcase consists of a single line of input containing 5 integers $a$, $b$, $c$, $d$ and $n$.\n\n###Output:\nFor each testcase, in a single line, output the $n^{th}$ number written on the board modulo $10^9+7$.\n\n###Constraints \n- $1 \\leq t \\leq 10000$\n- $1 \\leq a, b, c, d, n \\leq 10^9$\n\n###Sample Input:\n\t5\n\t1 1 2 1 1\n\t1 1 2 1 2\n\t1 1 2 1 3\n\t1 1 2 1 4\n\t1 1 2 1 5\n\n###Sample Output:\n\t1000\n\t7\n\t1007\n\t2021\n\t3028\n\t\n###EXPLANATION:\nFor all the testcases in the sample input, $a=1$, $b=1$, $c=2$ and $d=1$. For $n=1$, the answer is the first number written on the board, which, according to the question, is 1000. For $n=2$, again, according to the question, the answer is 7. For $n=3$, Kaneki calculates $ax+by$ which is $1 \\times 7 + 1 \\times 1000 = 1007$. For $n=4$, Hide calculates $cx+dy$ which is $2 \\times 1007 + 1 \\times 7 = 2021$. Finally, for $n=5$, Kaneki calculates $ax+by$ which is $1 \\times 2021 + 1 \\times 1007 = 3028$.\n",
