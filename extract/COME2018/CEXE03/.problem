One day, they came across the game of [Nim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nim), but soon got disinterested once they found the winning strategy. Thus they created a new game, \u201cNim x Nim\u201d. The game is similar to single-pile Nim, except that in each turn, a player can take only 1 to $ceil(n/x)$ stones from the pile, where $n$ is the number of stones in the pile, $x$ is an integer parameter fixed at the beginning of the game and $ceil$ is the [ceiling function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floor_and_ceiling_functions). They enjoyed playing this game, with Gon playing first every time, but soon got curious: given a particular $n$ and $x$, and assuming that players play optimally, is it possible to predict the winner? Help them out!\n\n###Input:\n\n- The first line contains 2 integers $x$ and $t$, the parameter for Nim x Nim and the number of test cases.\n- $t$ lines follow, each of which contains a single integer $n$, the number of stones in the pile at the beginning of each game.\n\n###Output:\nFor each test case, if the first player can win assuming both players play optimally, in a new line, print \u201cGon\u201d, else print \u201cKillua\u201d.\n\n###Constraints \n- $1 \\leq x \\leq 5\\times 10^6$\n- $1 \\leq t \\leq 10^6$\n- $0 \\leq n \\leq 5\\times 10^6$\n\n###Sample Input:\n    2 6\n    1\n    2\n    3\n    4\n    5\n    6\n\n###Sample Output:\n    Gon\n    Killua\n    Gon\n    Gon\n    Gon\n    Killua\n\n\t\n###EXPLANATION:\nFor $n=1$ and $x=2$, on the first turn, Gon can remove at most $ceil(1/2)=1$ stone. Since removing one stone will make Gon win the game, \"Gon\" is printed.\n\nFor $n=2$ and $x=2$, on the first turn, Gon can remove at most $ceil(2/2)=1$ stone. Thus, the only move available to him is to remove one stone, and now $n$ becomes 1. Killua can remove $ceil(1/2)=1$ stone on his turn and win the game, so \"Killua\" is printed.\n",
