Looking after stuff is really boring, so Barles decides to while away the time by performing a (small) task. He's obsessed with the number 2, so he defines a \"fantastic integer\" as an integer that can be expressed as the **_sum of exactly two powers of 2_**. Thus, he wants to count the number of fantastic integers present in the array. He quickly realises that it's not an easy task, but he doesn't want to leave the task incomplete. He hasn't heard of computers and all that newfangled stuff, so help him out!\n\n###Input:\n\n- The first line contains $n$, the number of elements in the array.\n- The second line contains $n$ space-separated integers, the elements present in the array (let's call the array '$arr$').\n\n###Output:\nOutput, in a single line, the number of fantastic integers present in $arr$.\n\n###Constraints \n- $1 \\leq n \\leq 1000000$\n- $1 \\leq arr_i \\leq 10^{18}$\n\n###Sample Input:\n\t5\n\t1 2 3 4 5\n\n###Sample Output:\n\t4\n\t\n###EXPLANATION:\nIn the given array, except 1, all the other elements can be represented as sums of powers of two (2=1+1, 3=1+2, 4=2+2, 5=1+4). Hence, the output is 4.\n",
