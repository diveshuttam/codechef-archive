To save the universe, they decide to use it to go back in time whenever necessary without causing severe changes to the laws of nature. Help them by answering a few queries.\n\nThe infinity stones are numbered with indices starting from 0. Assume every query happens in one unit time and are numbered from 1 to $q$. Before any of the queries are executed, Thanos does not have any infinity stones. At each instant of time any one of the following three can happen:\n- Thanos collects the $i^{th}$ infinity stone.\n- The Avengers use the Time Stone to go back to the state after the $i^{th}$ query. It is guaranteed that when this query is encountered, the $i^{th}$ query has already been executed.\n- The Avengers ask you to print the least-indexed infinity stone which Thanos has still not taken, so that they can find it before Thanos and use it against him.\n\nPerform all the queries successfully to save the universe!\n\n###Input:\n- The first line contains a single integer $q$ denoting the number of queries.\n- $q$ lines follow, which may be of the following 3 types:\n    1. $1$ $x$ : Add $x$ to the set of infinity stones collected by Thanos.\n    2. $2$ $i$ : Go back in time to the state after the $i^{th}$ query (if $i$=0, it indicates the state before any queries have been performed).\n    3. $3$ : Print the least-indexed infinity stone that Thanos has not yet collected.\n\n###Output:\nFor all queries of type 3, print the least indexed infinity stone still not collected by Thanos.\n\n###Constraints: \n- $0 \\leq x \\leq 10^8$\n- $1 \\leq q \\leq 2 \\times 10^5$\n- $0 \\leq i < q$\n\n###Sample Input:\n\t7\n\t1 0\n\t3\n\t1 1\n\t3\n\t2 2\n\t1 2\n\t3\n\n\n###Sample Output:\n\t1\n\t2\n\t1\n\t",
