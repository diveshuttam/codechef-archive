This set-up has one issue: the prison guard has a limited field of vision, and hence, at a given point in time, he can only view a limited number of cells (which are consecutive). \n\nThe prison guard wants you to solve the following problem: given $n$ (the number of cells in the panopticon), $k$ (the number of consecutive cells that he can view at any given time), $x$ (the number of prisoners currently present in the panopticon), and the cells in which the prisoners are located (The cells are numbered from 0 to $n$-1, and note that in specific, cell 0 will be adjacent to cell 1 and cell $n$-1), if the guard randomly views $k$ consecutive cells, what is the expected number of prisoners he will be able to surveil? Note that more than one prisoner can be in a given cell (even if other cells are empty) due to \u201cspecial requests\u201d.\n\n###Input:\n\n- The first line contains $n$, the number of cells in the panopticon.\n- The second line contains $k$, the number of cells the guard can view at any given time.\n- The third line contains $x$, the number of prisoners currently present in the panopticon.\n- $x$ lines follow: The ith line contains a single integer $a_i$ denoting that the ith prisoner is placed in cell $a_i$.\n\n###Output:\n\n- It can be proved that the expected number of prisoner can be represented in the form $P/Q$, where $P, Q$ are coprime integers. In a single line, print $(PQ^{-1})$ mod $10^9+7$, where $Q^{-1}$ denotes the modular multiplicative inverse of Q (modulo $10^9+7$).\n\n###Constraints\n- $1 \\leq n \\leq 10^9+10$\n- $1 \\leq k < n$\n- $1 \\leq x \\leq 10^6+10$\n- $0 \\leq a_i < n$ \n\n###Sample Input:\n\t5\n\t4\n\t1\n\t1\n\n###Sample Output:\n\t600000005\n\t\n###EXPLANATION:\nThere are 5 possible sets of consecutive cells that the guard can view. In 4 of them, 1 prisoner will be visible, while he won\u2019t be able to view any prisoner in one of them. Hence, $P/Q=\u2158$ and ($PQ^{-1}$) mod $10^9$+7 = 600000005.\n",
