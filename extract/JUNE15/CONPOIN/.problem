But his teacher was very careful so the boy had to pretend that he was solving some geometry problem. At first glance he started drawing some senseless stuff. He marked <b>N</b> pairwise different points on the plane and then connected <b>M</b> pairs of these points by <b>straight-line</b> segments. <b>No 3 points lie on the same line.</b> None of these segments intersect(maybe except at the initial <b>N</b> points). Then Leha tried to draw the <b>M+1-th</b> segment but surprisingly it turned out that it was impossible to connect any pair of points by <b>straight-line</b> segment which wouldn't intersect with any of the previous segments. </p>\n<p>Let's enumerate points from <b>1</b> to <b>N</b>. You are given <b>M</b> pairs of integers - numbers of points which are connected by the each straight-line segment. The question is: whether it's possible to choose <b>N</b> points on the Euclidean plane <b>in any way</b> such that they will <b>always</b> fit the situation described above. That is, try to place the given <b>N</b> points and <b>M</b> non-intersecting segments that are given, you will never be able to place <b>M+1</b>th segment.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The first line contains one integer <b>T</b> - the number of test cases. Each test case starts with a line containing two integers <b>N</b> and <b>M</b>. <b>M</b> lines containing a pair of integers each follow describing pairs of points connected by <b>straight-line</b> segments</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>For each test case output a single line containing<b>1</b> if it's possible to find points which will satisfy the problem statement and <b>0</b> otherwise</p>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>T</b> \u2264 <b>6000</b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>N</b> \u2264 <b>7*10<sup>4</sup></b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>M</b> \u2264 <b>3*10<sup>5</sup></b></li>\n<li>sum of all <b>N</b> in one test file doesn't exceed <b>7*10<sup>5</sup></b></li>\n<li>no segment connects a point with itself</li>\n<li>each pair of points is connected no more than by one segment</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Subtasks</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Subtask 1 : 1 \u2264 N \u2264 5 : ( 20 pts )</b></li>\n<li><b>Subtask 2 : no additional constraints: ( 80 pts )</b></li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n3\n3 3\n1 2\n2 3\n1 3\n3 2\n1 3\n2 3\n4 6\n1 2\n1 3\n1 4\n2 3\n2 4\n3 4\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n1\n0\n1\n</pre><p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p> In the first test case we can draw triangle on the plane. Obviously no pair of segments will intersect and we can't add any more straight-line segment(and even not straight-line) so the answer is <b>1</b> </p>\n<p>In the second test case we can draw 3 points and connect 1 and 3 and 2 and 3. But we can add one more(1 and 3) so the answer is <b>0</b></p>\n<p>In the last test case we can draw a triangle and a point inside it connected to 3 vertexes of the triangle. As in the first test case we can't connect some new pair so the answer is <b>1</b> too.</p>\n",
