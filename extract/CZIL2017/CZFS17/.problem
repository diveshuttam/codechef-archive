Mr A then got an array of <strong>N</strong> numbers from somewhere, as he was very bored so he started playing with the numbers. <br />He took the <strong>N</strong> numbers and started finding out the <strong>max value of two adjacent numbers</strong> for every pair of adjacent numbers in the array and wrote all of them in next line, so he got <strong>N-1</strong> numbers in the next line. Now he took the <strong>N-1</strong> numbers and started finding out the max of two adjacent numbers for every pair of adjacent numbers and wrote the resultant <strong>N-2</strong> numbers in the next line. He repeated this process again and again untill only one number is left.</p>\n<p>Now he gave Mr B the task to find the sum of the all the numbers that are now written on the paper. Mr B wasn't able to figure out a solution for this problem and approched you for the solution. So help Mr B solve this question.<br>\nSince the sum can be very large, you need to print the <b>answer modulo 10<sup>9</sup>+7</b>.</p>\n<p><strong>Input</strong><br />In the first line you will be given <strong>T</strong> which is the number of test cases. For each of the test cases you will be given two lines as input, the first line is <strong>N</strong> and in the second line you will have <strong>N</strong> numbers which are the values of the numbers in the array.</p>\n<p><strong>Output</strong><br />For each test case you have to print the required sum in new line.</p>\n<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>\n<p>1 &lt;= <strong>T</strong> &lt;= 25<br />1 &lt;= <strong>N</strong> &lt;= 10<sup>6</sup><br />1 &lt;= <strong>A<sub>i</sub></strong> &lt;= 10<sup>7</sup></p>\n<p><strong>Example</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Input</strong></p>\n<p>2<br />4<br />1 2 3 4<br />6<br />2 5 7 3 1 8</p>\n<p><strong>Output</strong><br />30<br />130</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong>Explanation</strong><br />In the first test case following pattern will be formed after Mr A has done playing with the numbers :<br />1 2 3 4<br />\u00a02 3 4<br />\u00a0 3 4<br />\u00a0\u00a0 4<br />So the sum of all the numbers written above comes out to be 30.</p>",
