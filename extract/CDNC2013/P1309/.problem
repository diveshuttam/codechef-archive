The dots are colored in m different colors such that there are exactly 2 dots of each color. The dots are placed at the coordinates (1,0), (2,0), ..., (2m, 0).<br /><br />\nYour task is to draw a path for each color that joins the two dots of that color. Each path should be composed of vertical or horizontal line segments between grid points. No two paths can intersect or touch each other. No path may cross the y=0 line. Each path can only touch the y=0 line at the position of the two marbles it is connecting, so the first and last line segment of each path must be vertical.<br /><br /><br />\nGiven an arrangement of dots, return the minimum height of a solution, or return -1 if no solution exists.<br /><br />\nThe height is defined as the difference between the highest and lowest Y-coordinates of the paths used.<br /><br />\nAn example:<br /></p>\n<pre>\tgreen \t   green \t  yellow \t   red     yellow     red<br />\nOne solution would be:\n<pre>\n                                          __________\n                                         |                       |\n  green ---- green     yellow     red     yellow     red\n\t\t\t                             |____________|\n\n</pre><p>The minimum height is 2 in this case.</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The first line of input gives the number of test cases, T, followed by the cases.<br />\nThe first line of each case contains m, the number of different colors for the marbles.<br />\nThe next line contains a string of 2m words separated by spaces which correspond to the colors of the<br />\ndots, in order from left to right.\n</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>For each test case, output the line containing the height of any optimal solution, or -1 if no solution exists.\n</p>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<pre>1 &lt;= T &lt;= 50.\n1 &lt;= n &lt;= 20.\n Each color is a string of lower case letters ('a' .. 'z') no longer than 10 characters. \nThere will be exactly n different colors and each color will appear exactly twice.\n</pre><h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n4\n3\norange orange red yellow red yellow\n3\nblack blue white black blue white\n3\nbrown green yellow green yellow brown\n3\npink pink blue blue yellow yellow\n\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n2\n-1\n3\n1\n\n</pre></pre>",
