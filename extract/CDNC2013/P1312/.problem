The teachers decided to set the following rule to prevent cheating. Assume a student is able to see his left, right, upper-left, and upper-right neighbors' answer sheets. The assignment of seats must guarantee that nobody's answer sheet can be seen by any other student.<br /><br /><br />\nSome seats of the classroom are broken and no student can be made to sit on the broken seat.<br /><br />\nYour goal is to find the maximum number of students that can be placed in the classroom so that no one can cheat.\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The first line of input gives the number of cases, C. C test cases follow. Each case consists of two parts.<br />\nThe first part is a single line with two integers M and N: The height and width of the rectangular classroom.<br />\nThe second part will be exactly M lines, with exactly N characters in each of these lines. Each character is either a '.' (the seat is not broken) or 'x' (the seat is broken, lowercase x).\n</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>For each test case, output one line containing \"Case #X: Y\", where X is the case number, starting from 1, and Y is the maximum possible number of students that can take the exam in the classroom.</p>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<pre>C = 20\n1 \u2264 M \u2264 80\n1 \u2264 N \u2264 80\n</pre><h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n4\n2 3\n...\n...\n2 3\nx.x\nxxx\n2 3\nx.x\nx.x\n10 10\n....x.....\n..........\n..........\n..x.......\n..........\nx...x.x...\n.........x\n...x......\n........x.\n.x...x....\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n4\n1\n2\n46\n\n</pre><p>\u00a0</p>\n",
