Now one fine day his soldiers brought two robbers. In order to punish them the king ordered his men to draw &lsquo;N&rsquo; contiguous blocks and in the Nth block fire was setup. Now the king ordered both the robbers to step in the first block and told them the rules :<br/>\n&bull;\tThe robbers would decide the next block where to jump.<br/>\n&bull;\t They would decide alternately.<br/>\n&bull;\t If they are in the &lsquo;k&rsquo;th block the next block can be k+1 or 2k.<br/>\n&bull;\tThe robber who decides the block where to jump would step in that block first followed by the other.<br/>\n&bull;\tThe first robber would start.<br/>\n&bull;\tThey have to make a decision and cannot cross N\nSo the robber who will have no other option than to choose the Nth block would die. The other robber would be freed for his wit.<br/>\nNow you have find for an N which robber would die. Both the robbers are highly intelligent \n\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>First line would contain T, the number of test case followed by T lines. In each line there would an N.\n1<=T<=50 1<=N<=(10^17) - 1\n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>For each test case you have to print who will be freed. Print either &ldquo;First&rdquo; or &ldquo;Second&rdquo;. For each test case answer in a new line\n\n<h3>Example</h3>\n\n<pre>\n<b>Input:</b>\n3\n5\n10\n34\n\n\n<b>Output:</b>\nSecond\nFirst\nSecond\n\n</pre>",
