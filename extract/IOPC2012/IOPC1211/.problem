They have to give him an integer N and he will immediately respond with a number which has more than N factors.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">What the prodigy really does is to do some complex calculations in his head to find out the smallest integer with more than N factors. However, he has a weakness - he knows to do those calculation only on numbers up to 10<sup>19</sup>, so if the answer to be reported is more than 10<sup>19</sup>, he will not be able to come up with his solution and will lose the game.</p>\n\n<p align=\"justify\">Given the integer the people give to the prodigy, you need to report whether he wins the game or not. If he wins, also output his answer.</p>\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p align=\"justify\">The first line of input contains T (T \u2264 25), the number of test cases. Following this are T lines, each containing an integer N (1 \u2264 N \u2264 10<sup>9</sup>) - the number which is given to the prodigy.</p><p>\n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n</p><p align=\"justify\">Output one line per test case. If the smallest integer X with more than N factors is bigger than 10<sup>19</sup> so that the prodigy does not win, print \"lose\". Otherwise print \"win X\" (quotes for clarity).</p>\n\n<h3>Example</h3>\n\n<pre>\n<b>Input:</b>\n3\n3\n5\n12345678\n\n<b>Output:</b>\nwin 6\nwin 12\nlose\n\n</pre>",
