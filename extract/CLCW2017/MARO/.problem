Abizer the romeo is all set to date the princesses of the kingdom. These princesses live in 'Critical cities'. A Critical city is a city which, if destroyed along with the roads going from the city, then atleast one pair of cities wouldn\u2019t have a route between them.<br>\n<br>\nAbizer has decided a unique gift corresponding to each princess. But he likes only <b>K</b> princesses. Abizer has already decided the <b>K</b> princesses he would date.\nHe would send correct gifts to only those chosen <b>K</b> princesses, and none of the other princesses would receive the correct gift (Each one will receive one gift but not the one which was meant for her).<br>\n<br>\nAbizer wonders in how many ways can he do this, and thus calls Shubham to get his question answered.\nHelp Shubham, who is busy with something else answer the question.<br><br>\n\nAs the number of ways may be huge, Shubham expects the answer modulo 10^9+7.<br>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>\nThe first line contains an integer <b>N</b><br>\n<b>N</b> is the number of states in the country.<br>\nThe second line contains an integer <b>M</b>.<br>\n<b>M</b> is the number of routes in the city.<br>\nThe third line contains an integer <b>Q</b>, denoting number of queries.<br>\n<b>M</b> lines follow. Each line contains 2 integers denoting a route between the given two states.<br>\n<b>Q</b> lines follow corresponding to <b>Q</b> queries.\nEach line contains the <b>K</b> for the query.<br>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>Output the number of ways modulo 10^9+7 on a new line corresponding to each query.\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<p>Should contain all the constraints on the input data that you may have. Format it like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>N,Q</b> \u2264 <b>10^5</b></li>\n<li><b>0</b> \u2264 <b>K</b> \u2264 <b>N</b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>M</b> \u2264 <b>2*10^5</b></li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n4 \n3\n2\n1 2 \n2 3\n3 4\n0\n1\n<br>\n<b>Output:</b>\n1\n0\n<br>\n</pre>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p><b>Example case 1.</b><br>The tree is basically 1->2->3->4-><br>Node 2 and 3 are critical cities as their removal would disjoin atleast a pair of nodes of the graph<br>Now, for k=0, the number of ways to send gifts to the princesses such that they dont get their desired gifts is 1, princess 2 gets princess 3's gift and 3 gets 2's gift, hence the answer is 1<br>For k=1, there are 0 ways of sending the wrong gift to the princess he doesnt date as there is just one princess he doesnt want to date, hence answer is 0</p>",
