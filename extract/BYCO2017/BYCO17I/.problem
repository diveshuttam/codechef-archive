Only a few of these square units are viable for planting. \n<br><br>\nGrowing roses at a given co-ordinate square would incur some cost. Let the location of this square in a 2-dimensional plane be denoted as (X,Y).\n<br><br>\n\nAshritha\u2019s dad Raj, has an excellent skill set when it comes to Financial Analysis. He devised a technique of evaluating this cost. The efficiency of his evaluation function was proven by his regression analysis on historic data.\n<br><br>\n \nThe estimation technique is as follows: \n<br>\n<ul>\n<li>The cost for planting the first rose is 0.</li>\n<li>For every additional rose the cost of planting it at location (A,B) would be the Maximum Fenwick distance between (A,B) and already planted roses.</li>\n</ul>\n<br>\nFenwick distance between points (x1,y1) & (x2,y2) is given by :\nmax(|x1-x2| , |y1-y2|)  \n<br><br>\nAssume that 2 adjacent squares are 1 unit apart. Help Ashritha and her family to estimate the cost for covering their lovely garden with roses. They would like to plant roses at every viable spot marked on the map.\n<br><br>\n</p>\n\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>Input description.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>First line comprises of two space separated integers P,Q.<br>\nFollowing is a P x Q matrix Z.<br>\nZ[i,j] : 1  => viable for rose planting <br>\nZ[i,j] : 0  => not viable for rose planting <br>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>Output description.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Output a single line with minimum possible cost.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<p></p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>P</b> \u2264 <b>70</b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>Q</b> \u2264 <b>70</b></li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n4 4 \n1 0 0 0\n0 1 0 0\n0 0 1 0\n0 0 0 1\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n6\n</pre>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p>Plant the first rose at (1,1) for free.<br>\nThen (0,0) : incurs cost 1 unit<br>\nThen (2,2) : incurs cost 2 units<br>\nThen (33) : incurs cost 3  units<br>\nTotal : 6\n</p>",
