He recently heard rumors of a coup being planned to dethrone him. His rumors have started to become true as the people of Bytelandia are now protesting on the streets\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe people of Bytelandia are disciplined and protest only by standing in a row. Also, each person is named with a single alphabet, leaving only 26 unique names( alarming lack of forethought in a nation of coders). Combining their names in order produces the row string of the protest.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nByteMan knows that the success of coup depends only on the power of the protest. The power of the protest depends on how lexicographically large the row string is.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nTo reduce the power of the protest, he can deploy coder platoons on the protesters and disrupt their activity. Each platoon can be deployed on a non-empty non-overlapping substring group. The coder platoon can just keep an eye on the substring group or reverse it if they feel the protesters are very violent.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut there is one condition: all the coder platoons together must cover the entire row string if deployed. Otherwise, the escaped protesters will hack ByteMan to death with their terminals :(\n</p>\n\n<p>\nByteMan can also decide not to deploy coder platoons if he feels the protest is already weak. In this case, the coders are sent on an all-expenses paid vacation to Dubai(yay!)\n</p>\n\n<p>\nByteMan only has K coder platoons in his army. Being his trusted advisor, help him find the optimal strategy to contain the revolt. Print the weakest possible ( lexicographically smallest) row string under given constraints\n</p>\n\n</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>Input description.</p>\n<p>The first line of the input contains row string <b>R</b>\n</p>\n\n<p>The second line contains number of coder platoons <b>K</b> under ByteMan </p> \n\n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>Output description.</p>\n<p>Print the weakest possible row string in the first and only line of output</p>\n\n\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>length(R)</b> \u2264 <b>1000000</b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>K</b> \u2264 <b>length(R)</b></li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<b>Input:</b>\n<pre>\nthisisbytecode\n1\n</pre>\n<br/><br/>\n<b>Output:</b>\n<pre>\nedocetybsisiht\n</pre>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p>\nByteMan has only one coder platoon with him. He can either deploy/not deploy that coder platoon.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIf deployed, the coder platoons must cover the entire row string. So, the coder platoon covers the entire row string. How many platoons are deployed is left to ByteMan. Reversing their substring group produces a weaker set of protestors. So <b>thisisbytecode</b> is transformed to <b>edocetybsisiht</b> by the coder platoon. \n</p>\n\n<p>\nThis is weaker than leaving the row string as such. Hence <b>edocetybsisiht</b> is the answer\n</p>",
