    "body": "<p>\nJalebi Bai recently met her long time friend Barfi Tai. Instead of entertaining her guest, Barfi Tai kept boasting about her <b>K</b> marvelous necklaces made of black and golden beads. Jalebi Bai felt really jealous of it and decided to exact revenge.\n</p>\n<p>\nShe has invited Barfi to visit her home next week. Meanwhile, she is planning to buy a truly beautiful necklace to make Barfi jealous. According to her, a truly beautiful necklace should contain each of Barfi\u2019s necklaces as a <b>subsequence</b> of it. Though still trying to show off, Jalebi Bai is smart and does not want to put a lot of money in it. So she wants to buy a truly beautiful necklace containing the minimum number of beads.\n</p>\n<p>\nShe goes to Devu Sunar and asks him to provide her such a necklace. Devu Sunar is busy this week and has asked you to help him in building the necklace. Please help him!\n</p>\n<h3>Note</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\nA subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some elements but without changing the order of the remaining elements. For example, the sequence [A,B,D] is a subsequence of [A,B,C,D,E,F].\n</li>\n<li>\nThe bead patterns on the necklaces are <b>not</b> considered circular.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The first line of the input contains an integer <b>T</b> denoting the number of test cases. The description of <b>T</b> test cases is as follows.</p>\n<p>The first line of each test case contains an integer <b>K</b> denoting the number of necklaces of Barfi.</p>\n<p><b>K</b> lines follow. Each of them contains a string made from the characters \u2018B\u2019 (representing black bead) and \u2018G\u2019 (representing golden bead), with the <b>i</b><sup>th</sup> line denoting Barfi Tai's <b>i</b>th necklace.</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>For each test case, output a truly beautiful necklace with the minimum number of beads. If there are more than one such necklace, you are allowed to print any of them.</p>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>T</b> \u2264 <b>30</b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>K</b> \u2264 <b>16</b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 length of each necklace of Barfi \u2264 <b>8</b></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n3\n2\nBG\nGB\n2\nBGB\nGG\n3\nBG\nGBB\nBGB\n<b>Output:</b>\nBGB\nBGGB\nBGBB\n</pre><h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p><b>In the first example</b>,<br />\nDevu can give necklace the BGB to Jalebi Bai, as it contains both the Barfi's necklace BG and GB as subsequence.<br />\nNote that Devu can also give GBG to Jalebi Bai.\n</p>\n<p><b>In the second example</b>,<br />\nDevu can give the necklace BGGB, as it contains both the Barfi's necklace BGB and GG as subsequence.<br />\nNote that there are many other possible truly beautiful necklaces of length 4, that Devu can give, e.g. BGBG or GBGB.<br />\nYou are allowed to print any of them.\n</p>\n<p><b>In the third example</b>,<br />\nDevu can give the necklace BGBB or GBGB. You are print any of them as your answer.</p>\n",
