Such that, i'th level of Piranhas in the triangle contains 2^(i-1) fishes and let's give a id number to each fish, such that, number of first fish in i'th layer is 2^(i) and second fish have id 2^(i) + 1 and so on.\nConsidering that each fish will only eat once and the fish with id = 1 will always attack the prey. He will always eat the first prey and pass the second prey to the left fish of next layer if the weight of the prey hundet is less than the last pray he  has eaten or to the right fish in the next layer if it's weight is more than the prey he has eaten and this rule apply to all the Piranhas.\nLet suppose there are k number of preys this group of deadly Piranhas have eaten today, the tash is to find the order in which this Piranhas have eaten today.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>First line contains integer t denoting number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains a single integer n denoting number of preys hunted today by the phiranas. Second line of each test case contains n space separated integers such that each integer denotes the weight of the pray in the order they were hunted.\n</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>Output the id's of all the phiranas in the order they have eaten the preys respectively space separated in a line for each test case.\n</p>\n\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>N</b> \u2264 <b>100000</b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>A[i]</b> \u2264 <b>100000</b></li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n1\n4\n5 3 2 9\n<br>\n<b>Output:</b>\n1 2 4 3\n</pre>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n",
