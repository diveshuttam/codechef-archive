One day, Little chef went to a mysterious country. The structure of the country can be described by a 2-D grid. Where each cell of the grid represents a town. Therefore, we can represent any town by a pair of integers <b>(x, y)</b>. Which means that the town is located at the<b> x<sup>th</sup></b> row (0  \u2264 <b>x</b>) and <b> y<sup>th</sup></b> column (0  \u2264 <b>y</b>) of the grid. </p>\n<p>\nMoreover, for transportation in the country, there are roads connecting the towns. Roads can be understood as a vertical and horizontal lines passing through each cell (towns) of the grid. See <a href = \"http://home.iitk.ac.in/~triveni/dots1.jpg\"> here </a> for better understanding of the structure of the country.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn some of the towns there are petrol pumps for refuelling. To be precise, there are <b> N </b> towns where petrol pumps are available. Let us number those towns from <b>1</b> to <b> N </b>.\n</p>\n<p>\nLittle chef is currently at town <b>1</b> with his car having no fuel. He has to go to town <b> N </b>. Available petrol in each petrol pump will be given. Formally let's denote that the <b>i<sup>th</sup></b> petrol pump has <b>p<sub>i</sub></b> units of petrol. Little chef has a lot of money so he can buy any amount of petrol, if available. Obviously he can't buy petrol if it is not available !\n</p>\n<p>\nHowever, in this country you are only allowed to move in two directions ! Formally if you are at town <b>(x, y)</b> then you can go to town <b>(x<sub>1</sub>, y<sub>1</sub>)</b> only if :</p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>x</b> = <b>x<sub>1</sub></b> and <b>y<sub>1</sub> </b>><b> y </b>or</li>\n<li><b>y</b> =<b> y<sub>1</sub> </b>and <b>x<sub>1</sub></b> > <b>x</b></li>\n<p>.</p></ul>\n<p>This is not the only rule that Chef has to follow ! Others rules that need to be followed as well are : </p>\n<ul>\n<li>He must travel in the roads.</li>\n<li>He can not make a turn in a town where there is no petrol pump !</li>\n<li>He can not stop in a town where there is no petrol pump. </li>\n<li>To take a turn, you must first stop at the point of turning. </li>\n<li>If he want to refuel his car, he must stop at a petrol pump. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>\nThe most mysterious thing about the country is that consumption of fuel is not proportional to the distance travelled ! Rather, total of only <b>K</b> units of petrol is consumed between two stoppage! However, it is impossible to continuously ride the car for a distance more than <b> L </b> without taking a stop. Distance between two towns<b> (x<sub>1</sub>, y<sub>1</sub>) </b>and <b>(x<sub>2</sub>, y<sub>2</sub>)</b> is given by <b>|x<sub>1</sub> - x<sub>2</sub>| + |y<sub>1</sub> - y<sub>2</sub>|</b>.\n</p>\n<p>\nLittle Chef simply wants to plan his travel from town <b>1</b> to town <b>N</b>. He already has the map of the country and he is aware of the rules. But, he got confused with so many rules! So he asked you for help. Can you help him ? You need to find a valid path for the Chef from town <b>1</b> to town <b>N</b>.\n</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>First line of the input contains three space separated <b>N</b>, <b>K</b> and <b>L</b>.\n<ol>\n<li><b>N</b> denotes the number of towns with petrol pumps. </li>\n<li><b>K</b> denotes the units of petrol that is needed between two consecutive stops as described in the problem. </li>\n<li><b>L</b> denotes the maximum distance that can be travelled in a continuous ride. </li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\nNext <b>N</b> lines contains three space separated integers each. Let's say that <b>i<sup>th</sup></b> line contains <b>x<sub>i</sub></b>, <b>y<sub>i</sub></b> and <b>p<sub>i</sub></b> respectively. These integers denote :\n<ol>\n<li><b>(x<sub>i</sub>, y<sub>i</sub>)</b> denotes the location of the  <b>i<sup>th</sup></b> petrol pump.</li>\n<li><b>p<sub>i</sub></b> denotes the amount of petrol available at the <b>i<sup>th</sup></b> petrol pump.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>If it is not possible for the Chef to reach to town <b>N</b> then print in a single line <b>\"NO\"</b> without quotes. </li>\n<li>Otherwise in the first line print \"YES\\n\".</li>\n<li>In the second line print the number of cities where the Chef stopped including town <b>1</b> and town <b>N</b>. Let's say you printed <b> M </b>.</li>\n<li>Then print <b>M</b> lines each containing two space separated integers denoting the location of the stoppage.</li>\n<li>All the stoppage should be printed in the same order in which they were visited.</li>\n<li>In the last line print the amount of fuel left in Chef's car after he stopped at the town <b>N</b>. Assume that he will not use the petrol pump of town <b>N</b>.</li>\n<li>See example and explanation for better understanding.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b><u>Note</u> that multiple answers are possible. Any of the correct solution will be accepted !</b></p>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>N</b> \u2264 <b>300000</b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>K</b> \u2264 <b>1000</b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>p<sub>i</sub></b> \u2264 <b>1000</b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>L</b> \u2264 <b>1000000</b></li>\n<li><b>0</b> \u2264 <b>x<sub>i</sub>, y<sub>i</sub></b> \u2264 <b>100001</b></li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n7 4 8\n1 1 7\n4 10 3\n10 1 1\n10 4 8\n6 1 4\n5 5 6\n10 10 4\n\n<b>Output:</b>\nYES\n5\n1 1\n6 1\n10 1\n10 4\n10 10\n4\n\n</pre><pre><b>Input:</b>\n7 4 4\n1 1 7\n4 10 3\n10 1 1\n10 4 8\n6 1 4\n5 5 6\n10 10 4\n\n<b>Output:</b>\nNO\n\n</pre><p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p><b>Example case 1.</b> One of the possible solution can be like the following :- </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Chef filled 7 unit of fuel at town <b>1</b>.</li>\n<li>Since a continuous ride of 8 unit is allowed, it is valid to take a stop at town <b>5</b>. </li>\n<li>Total fuel left at this point is 7 - 4 = 3 units. Then the Chef fills 4 units of fuel here. Now, total fuel in his tank = 7 units.</li>\n<li>Again he stops at town <b>3</b> for taking a turn. It is valid to stop here as there is a petrol pump here. Since, he has stopped here, he fills 1 unit of petrol here as well. Now, he has 7 - 4 + 1 = 4 units of fuel in his tank.</li>\n<li>Next stoppage he takes is town <b>4</b>. This was possible because he had 4 units of fuel in his tank earlier. However, it was not possible for him to directly go to town 7 from 3 as it is a distance of 9 units which is greater than <b>L = 8 </b>. He fills his tank here as well. Now fuel he has = 4 - 4 + 8 = 8 units.</li>\n<li>Next, he directly stops at <b>N = 7</b> with still 4 units of fuel in his tank.</li>\n<li>For this example, it is the only possible solution.</li>\n</ul>\n\n",
