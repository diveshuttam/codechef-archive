There are roads across certain pair of cities. There are exactly <b>N</b>-1 such roads. The roads are such that it is possible to go from any city to any other city using those <b>N</b>-1 roads.</p>\n<p>\nOne day Little chef and his brother Big chef decided to have a car race. Choosing the starting city and destination city was a big problem. Finally they settled with the following plan:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The starting point (source) of the race will be selected randomly and uniformly among the <b> N </b> cities.</li>\n<li>Destination point will be selected such that it is farthest from the source so as to have fair chance for both to show their talent !</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Little chef is wondering about what will be the expected distance to be traveled during the race ? He is seeking your help. Can you help him out ?</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The first line of the input contains an integer <b>T</b> denoting the number of test cases. The description of <b>T</b> test cases follows.</li>\n<li>The first line of each test case contains a single integer <b>N</b> denoting the number of cities in Byteland. Next <b>N</b>-1 lines each contains two space-separated integers <b>u</b> and <b>v</b>. Denoting that there is a road connecting city <b>u</b> and city <b>v</b>. The distance between them is <b>1</b>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>For each test case, output a single line containing the answer to the corresponding test case. That is the expected distance of the race.</li>\n<li>Your answer will be considered correct within absolute or relative error of 10^-6. </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>T</b> \u2264 <b>10</b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>N</b> \u2264 <b>200,000</b></li>\n<li>Input will be such that it is possible to go from any city to any other city using the given roads.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n1\n6\n1 2\n2 3\n3 4\n3 6\n2 5\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n2.66666666667\n\n</pre><h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p>Since the source city is selected at uniform and randomly, probability of selection of each city is 1/6. Hence, the answer will be the sum of \"distance of the farthest city\" from each node multiplied by 1/6.</p>\n<p>\n<b><u>Warning</u> : Large Input, be careful while reading Input !</b>\n</p>\n",
