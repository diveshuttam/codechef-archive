During the last few missions scientists found that human language can be \nrelated to the aliens language. In general the human language is born from sounds, but for a particular human sound there will be a specified unwanted string to be \nremoved from the human language in order to communicate with aliens. Now, we want you to help the astronauts by removing the unwanted string from the particular \nhuman sound(string) and displaying the remaining alphabets in alphabetical order with each remaining alphabet followed by number of times it appears in the human \nstring.</p>\n<p>NOTE:\n Human string or unwanted string doesn't contain any spaces between them.</p>\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>Input consists of two strings (strlen<1000) seperated by a space between them.\nOne corresponds to human string and other the unwanted string.</p>\n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>Output contains the remaining alphabets in alphabetical order with each remaining alphabet followed by the number of times it appears in the human string.</p>\n\n<h3>Example</h3>\n\n<pre>\n<b>Input:</b>\nabcdefghijk abcd\n\n<b>Output:</b>\ne1f1g1h1i1j1k1\n</pre>\n",
