He was amazed by the number of people one could have an affair with simultaneously. But after delving deeper into the issue he found out that SH has a pattern in her number of affairs she maintains at any point of time. Guru conjectures that at any point in time, the number of affairs SH has is always of the form \"a power b\"(suprising!). This conjecture is further strengthened by the fact that SH stalks a lot and is always bound to have lots of affairs.</p>\n<p>Your task is simple. You have to verify if Guru's conjecture is true. In other words, whenever Guru reports the current number of boyfriends SH is having, you have to report if its of the form a^b(both a,b >=2)</p>\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>Input description.</p>\n<p>\nEvery input contains a single integer n (2&lt;=n&lt;=10^16)\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The first line of the input contains an integer <b>T</b> denoting the number of test cases.
