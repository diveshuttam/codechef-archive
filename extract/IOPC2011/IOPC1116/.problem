She feels that to really understand group behavior, students need to practice working in groups of different sizes. This is how she groups the students:\n\n</p><p>There are N students in the class, with roll numbers from 1 to N(2\u2264N\u226410<sup>12</sup>). The teacher generates using her laptop a random permutation of the roll numbers. The student with the roll number equal to the i<sup>th</sup> number in the permutation is assigned as a \"target\" to the student with roll number as i (Note that \"targetship\" is not mutual. If 1 is the target for 2, 2 need not be the target for 1). If any student is assigned himself as the target, the teacher generates another permutation till no student is assigned himself.\n\n</p><p>The N students stand far from each other. Now student 1 goes and joins his target. After this, student 2 (and any student who is with him) joins 2's target. At the i<sup>th</sup> step, student i and anyone who is already with him joins i's target. In case i's target is already with him, nothing is done.\n\n</p><p>By following this procedure, when all students have joined their targets, the class gets split into some groups. For example, assume that there are 6 students in the class and the permutation that has been generated is {2,4,5,6,3,1}. First, 1 goes and joins 2. Then 1 and 2 join 4. Then 3 joins 5. Then 1, 2 and 4 join 6. 5 is already with 3 and hence does not move. Similarly 6 is already with 1 and does not move. In the end, we have 2 teams : {1,2,4,6} and {3,5}\n\n</p><p>Given N, find out the expectation value of the number of teams that will be formed when the teacher groups the class in this fashion.\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n</p><p>First line of the input contains T(\u2264100), the number of test cases. Following this are T lines, each containing an integer N(2\u2264N\u226410<sup>12</sup>).\n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n</p><p>For each N, output the expectation value of the number of groups formed. Output 6 digits after the decimal point while printing the expectation value\n\n<h3>Example</h3>\n\n<pre>\n<b>Input:</b>\n2\n3\n4\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n1.000000\n1.333333\n</pre></p>",
