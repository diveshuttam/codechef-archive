The sum of straight line distances from A to B and B to C is always greater than or equal to the straight line distance from A to C. Equality holds only when ABC is a degenerate triangle. This is the famous <b>triangle inequality</b>\n\n<p>In this case, distance between points is measured by the Euclidean metric. ie, the distance between points (x<sub>1</sub>,y<sub>1</sub>) and (x<sub>2</sub>,y<sub>2</sub>) is given by sqrt((x<sub>1</sub>-x<sub>2</sub>)<sup>2</sup>+(y<sub>1</sub>-y<sub>2</sub>)<sup>2</sup>). However, this is not the only metric possible. Another common metric used is the <b>Manhattan metric</b> where the distance between the pair of points is given by |x<sub>1</sub>-x<sub>2</sub>|+|y<sub>1</sub>-y<sub>2</sub>|\n\n<p>You are given N distinct points on a plane where distances are measured using the Manhattan metric. Find the number of ordered triplets of distinct points (A,B,C) such that the sum of distances from A to B and B to C is equal to the distance from A to C.\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The first line of input contains an integer T (<=10), the number of test cases to follow. \n<p>Following this are the descriptions of T test cases. Each test case description begins with an integer N (<=50000), the number of points. Following this are N lines, each giving the x and y coordinates of a point (0<=x<sub>i</sub>,y<sub>i</sub><=10<sup>8</sup>) separated by a space.\n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>Output T lines, each containing the number of ordered triplets of distinct points in every test case with the given property\n\n<h3>Example</h3>\n\n<pre>\n<b>Input:</b>\n2\n3\n0 0\n1 1\n2 2\n3\n0 0\n1 2\n2 1\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n2\n0\n</pre>\n",
