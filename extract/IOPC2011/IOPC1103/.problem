When he multiplies the number with 2, he gets 285714 which is a permutation of the digits of the original number. On multiplying with 3,4,5 and 6 too he observes a similar behaviour.\n\n<p>Now Prashant wants to find out truly magical numbers. A truly magical number of order N is a number P with the following properties:\n<ul>\n<li> P should have N digits and the first digit should be non-zero\n<li> On multiplying the number with any i such that 1<=i<=k, the result should be a permutation of the digits of P\n<li> There should not exist any N digit number Q (without leading zeros) with the property that for all i such that 1<=i<=k+1, Q*i is a permutation of digits of Q (Here k has the same value as in the previous point)\n<li> N should not have consecutive zero digits anywhere\n</ul>\n\n<p><p>It is easily seen that P=142857 is indeed a truly magical number of order 6. P has no leading zeros or consecutive zeros appearing anywhere. For 1<=i<=6, P*i is a permutation of digits of P. Also, there does not exist any number Q such that for all 1<=i<=7, Q*i is a permutation of digits of Q.\n\n<p>Given an integer N, find a truly magical number of order N. Note that for certain values of N there may be more than one truly magical number of order N. In such a case, it is enough to output any one of the truly magical numbers of order N.\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The first line of input contains an integer T (<=100), the number of test cases to follow.\n<p>Following this are T lines, each containing an integer N, 250<=N<=40000\n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>Output T lines, each containing a truly magical number of order N\n\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<p>The input limits are such that an example cannot be shown here. However, to explain the formatting of the input and output, we show here a sample case that has N outside the input limit range\n\n<pre>\n<b>Input:</b>\n2\n2\n6\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n13\n142857\n</pre>\n",
