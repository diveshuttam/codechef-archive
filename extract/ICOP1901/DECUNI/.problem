    "body": "<span class=\"solution-visible-txt\">All submissions for this problem are available.</span>Chef has finally finished school and is now deciding to go to a university, however, Chef is confused between so many universities he can go to. Chef lives in Byteland, which has $N$ cities, connected to each other by $M$ road each of length 1 kilometer. Each city has exaclty 1 university. Chef currently lives in city 1. Oddly, he is going to decide which university he wants to attend by two factors: the shortest distance to the city from his house and the number of cities adjacent to the city connected by a road of 1 km. \n\nHe has $Q$ queries regarding this. In each query he wants to know whether there exists a university which has a shortest distance of exactly $D$ km from his house, and has exactly $K$ adjacent cities. \n\n###Input:\n\n- First line will contain three integers, $N$, $M$, and $Q$\n- The next $M$ lines will contain two integers, u and v, which means that there is a biderectional road from city v to city u\n- The next $Q$ lines will contain two integers, $D$ and $K$. \n\n###Output:\nFor each query, output on a new line, \"YES\" if there exists a city following Chef's criteria, else output \"NO\"(without \"\").\n\n###Constraints \n- $2 \\leq N \\leq 10^5$\n- $1 \\leq M \\leq 10^5$\n- $0 \\leq D, K \\leq N$\n- $1 \\leq u, v \\leq N$\n- $u \\neq v$\n- Between each pair of cities, there can be atmost 1 road (no multi-edges)\n- The graph is connected\n\n###Subtasks\n- 30 points : $Q = 1$\n- 70 points : $1 \\leq Q \\leq 10^5$\n\n\n###Sample Input:\n\t6 8 4\n\t1 3\n\t3 5\n\t3 4\n\t2 4\n\t4 6\n\t5 6\n\t1 5\n\t2 6\n\t1 3\n\t1 2\n\t4 2\n\t4 3\n###Sample Output:\n\tYES\n\tNO\n\tNO\n\tNO\n\t\n###EXPLANATION:\nQuery 1: City 3 is 1 km away and has 3 adjacent cities\nQuery 2, 3, 4: No such city exists\n\n\n",
