Her installation will consist of a sequence of bamboo shoots of increasing lengths, abstractly representing the ascent of culture in the world. She also wants to arrange the bamboo shoots so that the difference in length between adjacent bamboo shoots remains the same, to maintain symmetry.<br><br>\nShe has with her a set of bamboo shoots. She will only use the bamboo shoots as they are, because cutting bamboo goes against her principles. Your task is to determine the maximum number of bamboo shoots she can use from this set as part of her installation.<br><br>\nSuppose she had a collection of 7 bamboo shoots of lengths 15, 8, 10, 20, 17, 13, 5. From these, she could pick bamboo shoots of lengths 13, 15 and 17 to form an installation of size 3. Alternatively, she could pick bamboo shoots of lengths 5, 10, 15 and 20 to form an installation of size 4. You can check that she cannot form an installation of size 5 or higher using this collection.<br><br>\nIn this task, you will be given a number <em>N</em>, describing the number of bamboo shoots in Lavanya\u2019s collection and the lengths of the <em>N</em> bamboo shoots. You may assume that no two bamboo shoots in the collection have the same length.<br><br>\nYour task is to output the size of the largest installation that Lavanya can create out of these\nbamboo shoots.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<h3>Input format</h3>\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>There is only one line, which contains <em>N</em> + 1 space separated integers. </li>\n\t\t<li>The first integer is <em>N</em>, giving the number of bamboo shots. </li>\n\t\t<li> That is followed by <em>N</em> distinct, non-negative integers, giving the lengths of the <em>N</em> bamboo shoots. </li>\n\t</ul>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<h3>Output format</h3>\n\tOne line containing a single integer giving the size of the largest installation that Lavanya can create.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<h3>Test data</h3>\n\t<p> You may assume that the lengths of the bamboo shoots lie in the range 0 to 10<sup>5</sup>, both inclusive. You may also assume that all bamboo shoots have distinct lengths. </p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<b>Subtask 1 (40 Marks)</b> You may assume that 1 \u2264 <em>N</em> \u2264 400, where <em>N</em> is the number of bamboo shots.<br>\n\t\t<b>Subtask 2 (60 Marks)</b> You may assume that 1 \u2264 <em>N</em> \u2264 2500, where <em>N</em> is the number of bamboo shots.<br>\n\t</p>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<h3>Sample Input</h3>\n\t<pre>7 15 8 10 20 17 13 5</pre>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<h3>Sample Output</h3>\n\t<pre>4</pre>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\t<h3>Explanation</h3>\n\t<em>N</em> = 7, and the bamboo shoots have lengths {15, 8, 10, 20, 17, 13, 5}. This is the same example explained above. So the answer is 4.\n</p>",
