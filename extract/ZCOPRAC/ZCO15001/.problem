The sequences 23, 45, 23 and 23, 45, 56, 23, 23, 56, 45, 23 are examples of palindromes. The sequence 23, 45, 56 is not a palindrome. The sequence 23, 32 is not a palindrome either. A sequence of length 1 is always a palindrome.</p>\n\n<br>\n<p>A given sequence of integers can be broken up into parts such that each of them is a palindrome. Consider the sequence 34,45,34,56,34. This can be broken up into 3 palindrome sequences with 34, 45, 34 constituting the first, 56 constituting the second and 34 constituting the third. It can also be broken in 5 palindrome sequences each containing a single number. Thus, there may be many different ways to break up a given sequence into palindrome sequences. We want to determine the smallest number <em>C</em> such that the given sequence can be broken up into <em>C</em> palindrome sequences.</p>\n\n<br>\n<p>Observe that for any palindrome sequence the value of <em>C</em> is 1. For the sequence 34, 45, 34, 56, 34 the answer is 3. Your aim is to write a program that computes this number for any given sequence.</p>\n\n\n<br>\n<h3>Input format</h3>\n\n<p>The first line contains <em>N</em>, the number of values in the sequence.</p>\n\n<br>\n<p>This is followed by a line containing <em>N</em> positive integers separated by space giving the values\nof the sequence.</p>\n\n<br>\n<h3>Output format</h3>\n\n<p>Output a single integer giving the smalllest number <em>C</em> so that the given sequence can broken up into <em>C</em>palindrome sequences.</p>\n\n<br>\n<h3>Test data</h3>\n\n<p>You may assume that all integers in the input are in the range 1 to 10^8 inclusive.</p>\n\n<br>\n<p><b>Subtask 1 (100 marks)</b> : 1 \u2264 <em>N</em> \u2264 300.</p>\n\n<br>\n<h3>Sample Input</h3>\n\n<pre>\n5\n34 45 34 56 34\n</pre>\n\n<br>\n<h3>Sample Output</h3>\n\n<pre>\n3\n</pre>\n",
