With the walkers running behind, he needs to reach Kings Landing as fast as he can. Given N cities you know, provided City Number 1 is Current Location of Jon Snow and N being the Kings Landing, find if its possible for Jon and his team to reach with that walker. If yes, then what is the minimum time required?\n<br>\nOn serious note, Drogon and Khaleesi are too scared to fight with Walkers. Can you help Jon Snow? (He knows nothing, help him please!)\n</p>\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The first line of input contains the number of test cases.\n<br>\nEach test case starts with a line containing the number of cities N, the number of paths M. Cities are numbered from 1 to N. 1 being starting city(Jon's Location) and N being the ending city(Kings Landing).\n\nThen M lines follow, each describing one pathway. The description consists of the two distinct city numbers and the time in days to travel along the pathway. The time will be between 1 and 1000.</p>\n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>\nFor each test case output a single line containing the minimum number of days it takes to get from the start to the destination. If no pathway exists, output NONE.</p>\n\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>2 \u2264 N \u2264 100000</li>\n<li>2 \u2264 M \u2264 100000</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n2\n4 2\n1 2 3\n3 4 5\n4 4\n1 2 1\n2 3 2\n3 4 1\n4 2 2<br>\n<b>Output:</b>\nNONE\n3\n</pre>",
