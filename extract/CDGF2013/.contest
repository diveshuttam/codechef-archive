Let me rephrase what it is intended to mean: <br>\r\n\r\n1. Your solution can be either right or wrong. Among the correct solutions the ones with least number of key strokes will get the best score i.e \"1\" and all other solutions will receive a fraction based how close they come to the best solution. <br>\r\n\r\n2. Users are ranked according to total points acquired from all accepted solutions. Ties will be broken by the total time for each user in ascending order of time. <br>\r\n\r\nApologies, for the inconvenience. </p>",
