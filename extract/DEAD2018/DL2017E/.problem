The\u00a0change began in\u00a0earnest. However, the\u00a0environment of\u00a0the Lava Planet\n    makes it impossible to\u00a0conduct manufacturing processes directly there. It is necessary to\u00a0transport huge\n    slabs of\u00a0the newly discovered raw material\u2026</p>\n<h2 id=\"sec3\" class=\"section\">Problem</h2>\n<p>\n    Beetlejumpers have container transporters \u2013 large transportation vehicles whose cargo\n    hold is a\u00a0rectangle with known dimensions.</p>\n<p>Location of\u00a0superlapis deposits is defined on a\u00a0grid consisting of\u00a0single units,\n    each of\u00a0which has at most four neighboring units. Two single units are neighboring,\n    if they have one common side. A\u00a0continuous area \u2013 an\u00a0area where it is possible\n    to reach its every unit from\u00a0every other unit of\u00a0the area by going through consecutive\n    neighboring units \u2013 of\u00a0superlapis deposits is called a\u00a0<span>slab</span>.\n    A slab can be cut into <span>pieces</span> for\u00a0the\u00a0purpose of\u00a0placing the\u00a0raw material\n    in a\u00a0container transporter.

Moreover,\n    an additional advantage would be to\u00a0obtain the\u00a0smallest possible\n    number of\u00a0pieces (loading each of\u00a0them means losing valuable time)\n    and making as few cuts of\u00a0the slab as possible (cutting such a\u00a0robust\n    material requires huge effort).</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"sec5\" class=\"section\">Input data</h2>\n<p>\n    The\u00a0first line of\u00a0the test set includes one integer <b>T</b> denoting the\u00a0number of\u00a0tests.\n    A\u00a0description of\u00a0each test consists of\u00a0the information regarding one slab of\u00a0superlapis.</p>\n<p>The\u00a0first line of\u00a0the description of\u00a0each test includes four natural numbers separated\n    with a\u00a0single space: <b>M</b>, <b>N</b>, <b>K</b> and <b>L</b>.
