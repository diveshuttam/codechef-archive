It is today that the\u00a0Members\n    of the\u00a0Beetle Parliament (MBPs) are electing the\u00a0members of\u00a0the Jumping Tribunal.</p>\n<p>Both parliamentary groups \u2013 the\u00a0Civil Faction and the\u00a0Military Faction \u2013 submitted their nominations.\n    The Jumping Tribunal will be selected from\u00a0those candidates in\u00a0a voting that is quite atypical by today\u2019s standards.\n    Each MBP has exactly two votes. One of\u00a0them says which candidate the\u00a0MBP would want in\u00a0the Tribunal,\n    the other \u2013 the\u00a0candidate the\u00a0MBP is vehemently opposed to. When all votes are gathered \u2013 in\u00a0compliance\n    with the\u00a0Beetle Constitution \u2013 the\u00a0Jumping Tribunal will be elected in\u00a0such a\u00a0manner that both votes\n    of\u00a0as\u00a0many MBPs as\u00a0possible corresponds to\u00a0the\u00a0selected Tribunal members.</p>\n<h2 id=\"sec3\" class=\"section\">Problem</h2>\n<p>\n    The Civil Faction submitted <b>A</b> nominations, the\u00a0Military Faction \u2013 <b>B</b> nominations. Each MBP\n    submitted precisely\n    two votes in\u00a0the manner described above. Because of\u00a0a strict party discipline, MBPs of\u00a0each faction vote in\u00a0favor\n    of one of\u00a0the nominees of\u00a0their own faction and against one of\u00a0the nominees of\u00a0the opposing faction. A\u00a0total\n    of <b>N</b> MBPs are entitled to\u00a0vote.</p>\n<p>The two votes (one favorable and one negative) cast by each MBP are considered as\u00a0two requests:\n    <em>\u201cplease include this candidate in\u00a0the\u00a0Tribunal\u201d</em> and <em>\u201cunder no\u00a0circumstances may the\u00a0candidate\n        be included in\u00a0the\u00a0Tribunal\u201d</em>. An MBP is content with the voting results only if both of his requests\n    have been fulfilled simultaneously. The elected representation of the Tribunal must ensure\n    the maximum number of MBPs who are happy with the voting results.</p>\n<p>Having all granted votes at your disposal propose the\u00a0final (and compliant with the\u00a0Beetle Constitution!) composition\n    of the\u00a0Jumping Tribunal. The\u00a0Tribunal may be composed of\u00a0any number of\u00a0candidates.</p>\n<h2 id=\"sec5\" class=\"section\">Input data</h2>\n<p>\n    The\u00a0first line of\u00a0the test set includes one integer <b>T</b> denoting the\u00a0number of\u00a0tests.\n    A\u00a0description of\u00a0each test includes detailed information regarding all votes cast in\u00a0the election.</p>\n<p>The\u00a0first line of\u00a0the\u00a0description contains three integers: <b>N</b>, <b>A</b> and <b>B</b>,\n    denoting respectively: the\u00a0number of\u00a0MBPs, the\u00a0number of\u00a0candidates of\u00a0the Civil Faction and the\u00a0number\n    of candidates of\u00a0the Military Faction.
