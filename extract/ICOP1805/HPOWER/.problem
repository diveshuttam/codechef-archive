The network begins as a set\nof canals leading off from the river. Lower down, each of these canals splits into multiple\nsubcanals. Similarly, each subcanal splits into multiple smaller channels, and so on.\nWherever a canal splits, including the place where the first set of canals takes off from the\nCooum, there is a hydroelectric plant. Every power plant has its own generating potential.\nThe power a plant produces is given by the product of its generating potential and the\namount of water that flows through it.\nEach canal in the network has a fixed capacity. Wherever a canal splits, there is a system\nof valves to regulate how the flow is distributed amongst the subcanals. No water is stored at\nany of the point in the network, so the amount of water that is distributed at each junction is\nequal to the amount of water that flows into the power plant at that junction. In particular,\nthe power plant at the start of the network can draw as much water from the river as the\ncapacities of the canals in the rest of the network will permit.\nThe task is to determine how to regulate the flow at each junction so as to maximize the\npower generated across the network.\nFor example, suppose there are 6 power plants, num-\nbered 1,2,. . . ,6, connected by 5 canals as shown on the\nright. The value by the side of each plant is its gen-\nerating potential, while each canal is labelled with its\ncapacity. In this network, the optimum water routing is\nas follows: at plant 1, send a flow of 4 both right and\nleft. The flow of 4 that reaches plant 2 splits equally to\nthe left and right. At plant 4, the incoming flow of 2 is\npassed on to plant 6. Notice that though the canal from\nplant 1 to plant 2 has capacity 6, we can only route a\nflow of 4 through this canal because of the bottlenecks\nlower down, on the canals from plant 2 to plant 5 and\nplant 4 to plant 6. The total power generated is (2 \u00d7 8)\nat plant 1, (3 \u00d7 4) at plant 2, (2 \u00d7 4) at plant 3, (2 \u00d7 2)\nat plant 4, (5 \u00d7 2) at plant 5 and (2 \u00d7 2) at plant 6, for\na total of 54.\n<a>https://imgur.com/a/tA5MA</a>\n</p>\n<p></p>\n\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The first line of input contains a single integer N, the number of power plants, which are\nnumbered 1, 2, . . . , N. This is followed by a line containing N integers, indicating the gener-\nating potentials of the N power plants from 1 to N. The next N\u22121 lines describe the canals.\nEach line consists of three integers, the power plant at the beginning of the canal, the power\nplant at the end of the canal and the capacity of the canal.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>A single integer, the maximum power that can be generated by all the power plants in the\noptimal water routing.</p>\n\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<p>You may assume that 2 \u2264 N \u2264 300. The capacity of each canal is also less than or equal to\n300. You may also assume that the final output can be stored as an int.\nFor simplicity, you may also assume that at each power plant, a canal splits into at most\ntwo subcanals and that the first power plant is always numbered 1.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input</b>\n6\n2 3 2 2 5 2\n1 2 6\n1 3 4\n2 4 6\n2 5 2\n4 6 2\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n54\n</pre>",
