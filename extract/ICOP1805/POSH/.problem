The city has been separated into residential zones with roads connecting the\nzones to each other. Some of the residential zones have shopping centres. Too late, the town\nplanners have discovered that the roads are narrower than they had realised and will all\nhave to be made one-way. In a last minute move, the planning authorities have decided to\nrandomly assign directions to the roads.\nThis has thrown the entire planning process into disarray. It turns out that not all\nresidential zones are equally convenient to live in. The town planners have classified a\nresidential zone as upmarket if it contains a shopping centre or if it is possible to follow the\none-way roads and reach at least one zone containing a shopping centre. Higher up in the\nvalue chain are the residential zones classified as posh. A posh residential zone is one from\nwhich every other residential zone that can be reached is upmarket.\nThe task is to identify the posh residential zones,\ngiven the layout of the residential zones with and with-\nout shopping complexes and the orientation of the roads\nbetween them.\nFor example, suppose the neighbourhoods are ar-\nranged as shown on the right, where a double circle\ndenotes a residential zone that contains a shopping com-\nplex. In this picture, zones 1, 2, 3 and 4 are all upmarket\nbut only zones 1, 2 and 4 are posh. Zone 3 is not posh\nbecause it is possible to reach zone 5 from zone 3 and\nzone 5 is not upmarket. <br>\n<a>https://imgur.com/a/FZYHb</a>\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The first line of input contains three integers, N, M and R, where N is the number of\nresidential zones, M \u2264 N is the number of zones with shopping complexes and R is the\nnumber of roads. Overall, the zones are numbered 1, 2, . . . , N. Among these, the zones with\nshopping complex are those numbered 1, 2, . . . , M.\nThis is followed by R lines of input describing the one-way roads. Each line consists of\ntwo integers, the starting zone and ending zone of the road.</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>A single line with a list of integers, indicating the posh zones. The posh zones should be\nprinted in ascending order.</p>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<p>\nYou may assume that N \u2264 10^5 and R \u2264 10^6 .<br>\n<b>Subtask 1 (50 points) - <b> n <= 3000 <br>\n<b>Subtask 2 (50 points) - <b> original constraints\n</p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n5 1 7\n4 2\n2 4\n2 1\n1 2\n3 1\n3 5\n5 5\n<b>Output:</b>\n1 2 4\n</pre>\n<p>\u00a0</p>",
