Thanks! --><p>Michael, Kevin and Jake are sharing a cake, in celebration of their Webby award. They named it VCake. Unlike other cakes they considered, this one has finite volume and surface area. It's shaped as a normal rectangular cake with dimensions <b>R</b> centimeters by <b>C</b> centimeters. For the purposes of this problem, we can forget about three dimensions and think of a cake as just a 2D rectangle.</p>\n<p>Chef will now cut the cake into three pieces, one for each person. However, the cake's shape and Chef's really old tools pose a few restrictions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Chef can only cut the cake, or a cake piece, across a line parallel to one of its sides. </li>\n<li>Chef can only cut the cake, or a cake piece, from end to end. That is, she cannot cut the cake partially. </li>\n<li>Chef can only cut the cake, or a cake piece, such that the sides of the resulting pieces (which will be rectangular in shape) are integers. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In addition, Michael, Kevin and Jake also have a few preferences of their own:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>They want their pieces to be connected (in one piece), and rectangular in shape.</li>\n<li>Michael wants his piece to have an area exactly <b>M</b> square centimeters. (Again, forget about a third dimension.)</li>\n<li>Kevin wants his piece to have an area exactly <b>K</b> square centimeters.</li>\n<li>Jake wants his piece to have an area exactly <b>J</b> square centimeters.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>With these restrictions, Chef is at a loss. Is it possible for Chef to accomplish this task? </p>\n<p><b>Please note that the entire cake should be used. There should be no leftover cake.</b></p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The first line of the input contains an integer <b>T</b> denoting the number of test cases. The description of <b>T</b> test cases follows.</p>\n<p>Each test case consists of a single line containing five space separated integers <b>R</b>, <b>C</b> <b>M</b>, <b>K</b> and <b>J</b>.</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>For each test case, output a single line containing either \u201c<tt>Yes</tt>\u201d or \u201c<tt>No</tt>\u201d (without quotes), denoting whether Chef can accomplish the task or not.</p>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>T</b> \u2264 <b>10<sup>5</sup></b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>R</b>, <b>C</b> \u2264 <b>10<sup>9</sup></b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>M</b>, <b>K</b>, <b>J</b> \u2264 <b>10<sup>18</sup></b></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n<tt>4\n4 5 10 4 6\n4 5 6 10 4\n4 5 4 6 10\n2 2 2 2 2</tt>\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n<tt>Yes\nYes\nYes\nNo</tt>\n</pre><h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p><b>Example case 1.</b> In this case, Chef can accomplish the task by doing the following slicing. </p>\n<!-- \npre tt\n _ _ _ _ _       _ _ _ _ _       _ _ _ _ _       _________ \n|         |     |         |     |         |     |M M M M M|\n|         | -- |_ _ _ _ _| -- |_ _ _ _ _| -- |M_M_M_M_M|\n|         |     |         |     |     |   |     |J J J|K K|\n|_ _ _ _ _|     |_ _ _ _ _|     |_ _ _|_ _|     |J_J_J|K_K|\n/tt /pre\n--><!-- \npre tt\n _ _ _ _ _       _ _ _ _ _       _ _ _ _ _       _________ \n|         |     |         |     |         |     |M M M M M|\n|         | -- |_ _ _ _ _| -- |_ _ _ _ _| -- |M_M_M_M_M|\n|         |     |         |     |     |   |     |J J J|K K|\n|_ _ _ _ _|     |_ _ _ _ _|     |_ _ _|_ _|     |J_J_J|K_K|\n/tt /pre\n--><!-- I'll make an image if I have time --><!-- I'll make an image if I have time --><p>\n<img src=\"https://www.codechef.com/download/upload/SNCKEL16/vCake-final.png\" height=\"160\" /></p>\n<p><b>Example case 4.</b> Here, Michael, Kevin and Jake each wants a piece with area <b>2</b>, but the total area of the cake is only <b>2\u00d72 = 4</b>.
