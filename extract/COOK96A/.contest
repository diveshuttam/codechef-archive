Also we believe that it is alright to refer to tutorials, books and other materials, learn a concept and then apply the same to solve a problem during a contest. But it is <strong>not alright to copy other people's solutions or seek other people's help to solve a problem without understanding it.</strong> The dividing line may seem to be thin but it can be captured by the spirit of learning. If whatever you are doing is making you learn while you do so, we tend to believe that it is alright. However, all the participants are expected to abide to <a class=\"button blue\" href=\"../codeofconduct\">CodeChef Code Of Conduct</a></p>\r\n<p>Not just that, as a token of motivation we also give away goodies to the winners of the contest.</p>\r\n<p><strong>For Indians:</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Top 10 from the Indian ranklist will win CodeChef laddus.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>For Rest of World:</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Top 10 from ranklist will win CodeChef laddus</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p class=\"last\">With CodeChef laddus, the winners can claim cool CodeChef goodies. Know more <a href=\"https://discuss.codechef.com/questions/51999/how-do-i-win-a-codechef-goodie\">here</a>.

Ties will be broken by the total time for each user in ascending order of time.</li>\r\n<li>The total time is the sum of the time consumed for each problem solved. The time consumed for a solved problem is the time elapsed from the beginning of the contest to the submittal of the first accepted run plus <strong>10</strong> penalty minutes for every previously rejected run for that problem.

Failing this, it may be considered plagiarism and the submission will be subject to disqualification.</li>\r\n<li>The number of submissions that one can make during the contest on the problem will be limited to 200 for Tie breaker problem and 500 for rest.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Note: You can now \"Code, Compile, and Run\" your codes on our newly launched <a href=\"../ide\">Online IDE</a>.</strong></p>\r\n<p>However, if you are using any other online development environment, make sure that other contestants don't have access to your code. As a contestant, you are responsible for making sure others don't access the code that you submit. If you use Ideone, make sure to mark your submission \"private\" (not secret)\".</p>",
