Dragonstone was the original seat of House Targaryen in Westeros, which they had colonized and fortified as the westernmost outpost of the Valyrian Freehold.</i></p>\n<p align=\"right\">(c) A Wiki of Ice and Fire</p>\n<p><img src=\"/download/extimages/5423a2b5abc2376c9e1cab20b3b68ddf.jpg\" height=\"250\" /></p>\n<p>After Robert's Rebellion(also known as the War of the Usurper), the island passed to Stannis Baratheon, who became the Lord of Dragonstone. It turned out, that there's a lot of secret chambers hidden underground the castle.</p>\n<p>In this problem we assume, that the secret chambers can be described as <b>N</b> points on the Cartesian plane, both coordinates of which are integers. The points are indexed with integers from 1 to <b>N</b>. There's a bidirected passage between any pair of the chambers.</p>\n<p>Let's consider two chambers <b>A(x<sub>1</sub>, y<sub>1</sub>)</b> and <b>B(x<sub>2</sub>, y<sub>2</sub>)</b>. Then it takes <b>|x1 - x2| + |y1 - y2|</b> minutes to travel through the passage, that connects chambers <b>A</b> and <b>B</b>.</p>\n<p>The passages are extremely dark, so it isn't safe to travel through them without a lantern.</p>\n<p>Stannis Baratheon has a very special lantern, which he's planning to use during the next <b>Q</b> trips between the secret chambers. Let's consider a single trip:</p>\n<p>At first, Stannis chooses a chamber <b>S</b> - where he's starting the trip - and a chamber <b>F</b> - where he's finishing the trip. After that, he chooses an integer <b>C</b>, which is the <i>capacity</i> of the lantern for the current trip. Stannis can refill the oil in his lantern at any chamber, but not passage. It means, that he cannot walk passages, that take more than <b>C</b> minutes to travel through. If <b>C</b> is too small, then there's a chance that Stannis won't be able to travel from chamber <b>S</b> to chamber <b>F</b>. On other hand, if <b>C</b> is too large, then the lantern will be quite heavy and Stannis will be exhausted by the end of the trip.</p>\n<p>Your task is pretty simple: determine the minimal number <b>C</b> for each Stannis's trip, such that he will be able to travel from <b>S</b> to <b>F</b>.</p>\n<h3>Note</h3>\n<p>\nMaybe, some of you aren't familiar with definitions from the statement.
