    "body": "<span class=\"solution-visible-txt\">All submissions for this problem are available.</span><p>\nYou are given a simple connected graph <b>G</b> with <b>N</b> vertices and <b>N</b> edges (a simple graph is an un-directed graph that has no loops and no more than one edge between any two different vertices).<br />\nIt is obvious that the graph <b>G</b> contains exactly one cycle and you can assume that the length of this cycle is odd (there are odd number of vertices in this cycle).<br />\nThe vertices are numbered from 1 to <b>N</b>. Each edge is assigned a corresponding integer weight.<br />\nYour mission is to stimulate two types of queries :</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\nUpdate query represented by <b>f u v</b>: change the sign of all the weights of the edges on the shortest path (you can see the definition of shortest path in this problem later on) from vertex <b>u</b> to vertex <b>v</b>.\n</li>\n<li>\nFind query represented by <b>? u v</b>: On the shortest path from vertex <b>u</b> to vertex <b>v</b>, find the (possibly empty) set of consecutive edges such that the sum of the weights is maximal. In other words, let's define the shortest path from <b>u</b> to <b>v</b> as <b>a_1, a_2, ..., a_k</b> (where <b>a_1</b> = <b>u</b> and <b>a_k</b> = <b>v</b>). You have to find <b>a_i</b> and <b>a_j</b> such that <b>i</b> &lt;= <b>j</b> and the sum of the weights of the edges of the path <b>a_i, a_(i + 1), ..., a_j</b> is as large as possible. You just have to find that sum.\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>\nThe shortest path between two vertices <b>u</b> and <b>v</b> is the path connecting them with the minimal number of vertices. In this problem, it is obvious that there is only one shortest path between any pair of vertices of <b>G</b>.\n</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The first line contains an integer <b>N</b>. Each of the next <b>N</b> lines represents an edge of the graph with three integers <b>u v c</b> which mean there is an edge connecting vertices <b>u</b> and <b>v</b> and it is has weight <b>c</b>.<br />\nThe next line contains an integer <b>Q</b>, the number of queries. Each of the next <b>Q</b> lines represents a query in one of the two forms above.\n</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>\nFor each <b>find</b> query, print the result of the query (the maximal sum) on a line.\n</p>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>1 &le; <b>N</b> &le; 100,000</li>\n<li>1 &le; <b>u</b>, <b>v</b> &le; <b>N</b></li>\n<li>-10,000 &le; <b>c</b> &le; 10,000</li>\n<li>1 &le; <b>Q</b> &le; 100,000</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre>\n<b>Input:</b>\n6\n1 2 1\n2 3 1\n3 1 1\n2 4 1\n4 5 1\n3 6 1\n3\n? 5 6\nf 2 3\n? 5 6\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n4\n2\n</pre><h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p>The shortest path from 5 to 6 is 5, 4, 2, 3, 6. All the edges on this path have weight 1 so the answer to the first query is 4. After the second query, the weight of the edge (2, 3) is - 1. The edges on the path 5, 4, 2, 3, 6 have weights 1, 1, -1, 1 respectively. so the answer for the third query is 2.</p>\n",
