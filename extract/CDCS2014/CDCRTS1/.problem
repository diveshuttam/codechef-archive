The game is very simple, initially Harry holds <b>h</b> candy wrappers and Ron holds <b>r</b> candy wrappers and one candy wrapper is in the box of candies. All <b>h+r+1</b> candy wrapper has a unique number in range <b>1,....,h+r+1</b> written inside it, Harry and Ron know this. They also know what numbers they currently hold. Whoever guesses the correct number inside the box will win the box of candies. The players will play turn by turns. But they have to play by rules. Rules are as follows.</p>\n<ul>\n<li> In each turn they have to guess either the number in the box or any number in the oppositions hand.</li>\n<li> If the player guesses the number in the box correctly he will win the game, if not the opposite player will win the game.</li>\n<li> If the player guesses any number in oppositions hand correctly then opposite player will put aside the wrapper which has this number, otherwise opposite player will simply deny it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br/></br/></p>\n<p>\nAssuming that both players are playing optimally and Harry starts. Harry want to know what are his chances to win the game.\n</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The first line of the input contains an integer <b>T</b> denoting the number of test cases. The description of <b>T</b> test cases follows.</li>\n<li>Each test case contains two integers <b>h</b> and <b>r</b> denoting the number of wrappers which Harry and Ron have respectively.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>For each test case, output a single line containing the probability of Harry winning the game. The output should be rounded to 9 places after decimal.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>T</b> \u2264 <b>20</b></li>\n<li><b>0</b> \u2264 <b>h</b> , <b>r</b> \u2264 <b>1000</b></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n4\n0 3\n0 1\n1 0\n2 2\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n0.250000000\n0.500000000\n1.000000000\n0.555555556\n</pre>",
