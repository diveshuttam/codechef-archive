    "body": "<p>Akshay as a child was immensely in love with the board game Snakes and Ladders. As he grew up he designed a game of his own based on the same lines. The game rules that he framed were somewhat like this :\n\n<br>1. You start from the initial position ie the first square\n<br>2. At each step you have two choices\n<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. move to next square\n<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. take the ladder/snake if available at the square\n<br>3. The ladders/snakes are only unidirectional\n\n<br>4. There are no ladders from one square to its next consecutive one and no 2 ladders or snake has same start and end coordinates.\n\n<br>5. The game is played via a fixed no. of coupons that a player gets at the beginning of the game. \n\n<br>6. The objective is to reach the finishing square as well as finishing all the given k coupons\n\n<br>7. The player forfeits a coupon for each step that he takes.\n\n\n\n<p>For a given configuration of the Board Game and K coupuns, Akshay wants to find out the number of different possible ways to complete the game successfully. Help Akshay solve his dilemma.\n\n\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The first line will contain a single integer d , the size of each side of the square board. Next line will contain l,the number of snakes and ladder in the board . Following l lines will contain 2 integer ai and bi each . Denoting their is ladder from ai to bi if bi > ai or a snake from ai to bi if ai > bi\n\nThe last line will contain k , the number of coupons.\n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>output will contain a single integer denoting the number of different ways possible ( modulo 1000000007 )\n\n\n<h3>Constraints:</h3>\n\n<p>1<=d<=10\n<br>l<=35\n<br>1<=ai<=d^2\n<br>1<=bi<=d^2\n<br>ai!=bi\n<br>ai+1!=bi\n<br>1<=k<=10000000\n\n\n<h3>Example</h3>\n\n<pre>\n<b>Input:</b>\n2\n1\n2 4\n2\n\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n1\n</pre>\n\n<br/>\n\n<h3>Explanation of input</h3>\n\n<p>first number 2 means board is of size 2X2 . There is one ladder starting from 2 and end 4 and you can reach the last square ie 4 in 2 steps in only 1 way.",
