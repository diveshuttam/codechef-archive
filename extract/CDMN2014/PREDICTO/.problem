The media is also involved and it starts conducting </p>\n<p>opinion polls in all the constituencies. In one such opinion poll which is done </p>\n<p>for the Bharatiya Java Party (BJP), the media lists all the constituencies in </p>\n<p>alphabetical order, conducts surveys and then reports the results as a string </p>\n<p>of W's and L's. A <i>W</i> indicates that the BJP is winning that constituency </p>\n<p>and an L indicates the it is losing it.</p>\n<p>Shri Chaiwala, the PM candidate for BJP is however not very happy with the </p>\n<p>opinion polls. He feels that the media is biased towards the other parties and </p>\n<p>has intentionally given incorrect results. So he calls for a press conference </p>\n<p>and quotes that \"The media has not given correct predictions. They have </p>\n<p>generated the results using a fake program. This program can give the correct </p>\n<p>results for atmost <i>P</i> consecutive constituency and incorrect results for </p>\n<p>atmost <i>Q</i> consecutive constituency.\"</p>\n<p>Your task is to help Shri Chaiwala find the maximum number of constituency </p>\n<p>they could win if the predictions can have atmost <i>P</i> consecutive correct </p>\n<p>results and atmost <i>Q</i> consecutive incorrect results.</p>\n<p><b>Input</b></p>\n<p>The first line of the input consists of the number of cases (T). T test </p>\n<p>cases follows. Each test case has 2 lines. The first line contains 2 numbers P </p>\n<p>and Q separated by a space. The next line contains a string of W's and L's </p>\n<p>which is the prediction given by the media.</p>\n<p><b>Output</b></p>\n<p>For each test case, output a single line containing the maximum number of </p>\n<p>seats that BJP could win.</p>\n<p><b>Constraints</b></p>\n<pre>\nT \u2264 50<br/>\n1 \u2264 P, Q \u2264 100<br/>\n1 \u2264 |prediction string| \u2264 100<br/>\n</br/></br/></br/></pre><p><b>Sample Cases</b></p>\n<pre>\n3\n2 2\nWW\n2 2\nWWWW\n1 1\nWL\n</pre><p><b>Output</b></p>\n<pre>\n2\n3\n2\n</pre><p><b>Explanations</b><br />\nLets denote C for a Correct prediction and I for an Incorrerct prediction.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In the first case, P and Q are 2. So you can have atmost 2 consecutive\n<p>correct and atmost 2 consecutive incorrect predictions. The possible strings </p>\n<p>are CC, CI, IC, II. If we apply these strings on the predictions, then the </p>\n<p>seats BJP can win are - 2 (CC), 1 (CI) , 1 (IC) and 0 (II). Therefore the </p>\n<p>answer is 2.</p></li>\n<li>In the second case, we can get 2 seats by applying 2 correct predictions\n<p>anywhere. However we can get 3 by using CCIC.</p></li>\n<li>If we use CI, because the first prediction is correct, BJP wins 1 seat and because the second prediction is incorrect( i.e. L is incorrect there) so they win that seat too. So answer is 2.</li>\n</ul>\n",
