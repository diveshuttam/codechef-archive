He worked day and night to take his <br />company to the next step of success. Due to his great efforts, the company opened many branches<br /> across the world in few years. But after <b>N</b> days, Mr. Xoxo died in an air crash while he was returning after <br />meeting his grandson Xuxu who was pursuing his Masters degree in India. </p>\n<p>After the death of Mr. Xoxo, the governing committee of \"AIRTIME\" decided to appoint Xuxu as the CEO of <br />the company. Xuxu agreed to join but before that he wanted to analyse the data of the company from its <br />very first day to the N<sup>th</sup> day <b>[1,N]</b> so that he could work efficiently.</p>\n<p>Initially, Xuxu has no information about the Mobile units sold on each day.He was given <b>M</b> updates from<br /> the different branches across the world which provides the three values <b>X Y V</b>. It means that the particular<br /> branch sold V mobile units on each day from<b> X<sup>th</sup></b> day to <b>Y<sup>th</sup> </b>day (Both Inclusive).</p>\n<p>The total mobile units sold by the company on <b>i<sup>th</sup></b> day can be found by adding all the values <b>V<sub>i</sub></b> of updates <b>M<sub>i</sub></b> which contains <b>i<sup>th</sup></b> day in its range <b>[X<sub>i</sub>,Y<sub>i</sub>]</b>.</p>\n<p>It is assumed that <b>M</b> updates are sufficient to get the required data for N days.</p>\n<p>Xuxu appoints you as a data analyst and asks you to answer his <b>Q</b> queries. For each query, he provides <br />you a value <b>D</b> and asks you to find the total number of pairs for which the difference between the total <br />mobile units sold on any two distinct days is <b>D</b>. </p>\n<p><b>Note</b>: <br /><br />\nFor each pair of days there exists only one pair, i.e. <b>( i , j )</b> is similar to <b>( j , i )</b> and should be counted <br />exactly once where <b>i</b> and <b>j</b> are the total units sold on that pair of days.<br /><br /></p>\n<pre>\n<b>Warning:</b>\nLarge I/O, Use scanf and printf instead of cin and cout in C++.<br />\n</pre>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p></p><p>\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer <b>T</b>, the number of test cases. Then <b>T</b> test cases follow.<br />\nThe first line of each test case contains two space separated integers <b>N</b> and <b>M</b>.<br />\nEach of the following <b>M</b> lines contains space separated three integers  <b>X Y V</b> .<br />\nThe next line contains <b>Q</b>.<br />\nEach of the following <b>Q</b> lines contains an integer <b>D</b>.\n</p>\n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>For each Test Case, output <b>Q</b> lines, each contains a single integer containing the total number of pairs for the corresponding query.\n</p>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<p>\n<b>1</b> \u2264 <b>T</b> \u2264 <b>2</b><br />\n<b>1</b> \u2264 <b>N,M</b> \u2264 <b>10^5</b><br />\n<b>1</b> \u2264 <b>X,Y</b> \u2264 <b>N</b><br />\n<b>0</b> \u2264 <b>V</b> \u2264 <b>10^13</b><br />\n<b>1</b> \u2264 <b>Q</b> \u2264 <b>10</b><br />\n<b>0</b> \u2264 <b>D</b> \u2264 <b>10^18</b>\n</p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre>\n<b>Input:</b>\n1\n5 5\n2 4 1\n3 5 2\n1 2 5\n3 5 4\n4 5 1\n3\n0\n1\n2\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n1\n5\n3\n</pre><h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p>The total mobile units sold on</p>\n<pre>\nday 1:  5\nday 2:  6\nday 3:  7\nday 4:  8\nday 5:  7\nfor D=0,  pairs are (7,7)\nfor D=1,  pairs are (5,6),(6,7),(6,7),(7,8),(7,8)\nfor D=2,  pairs are (7,5),(7,5),(8,6)\n</pre>",
