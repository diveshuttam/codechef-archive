He found the Ultimate question to Life, Universe<br /> and everything. But then there was captain Xoxo who wanted this supreme knowledge. To thwart the evil <br />plans of Xoxo, Lavit encoded the Ultimate question into a magical matrix. </p>\n<p>The magical matrix was a <b>M</b> X <b>N</b> matrix of characters where words can be formed by moving horizontally<br /> or vertically, and using each character at most once. When Captain Xoxo hears this news from a spy, he<br /> wages a war against Lavit. Lavit manages to keep the matrix to himself, but he forgets the ultimate<br /> question. Still he has his hands on a list of questions and he is sure the question was one from this list. <br />Now since finding all the words in the matrix is too tedious a task, Lavit needs you to find the question for him.</p>\n<p>You will be given access to the special matrix, and Lavit will give you his list of questions. You will need<br /> to tell Lavit the Ultimate question. You need to ignore character case while comparing.\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The first line will contain two Integers, <b>M</b> and <b>N</b>.<br /><br />\nThe next <b>M</b> lines will contain a string of <b>N</b> characters each.<br /><br />\nNext Line will contain an Integer <b>L</b> denoting number of questions in Lavit's list.<br /><br />\nEach of the next <b>L</b> lines will contain a question.\n</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>Output a single line, The ultimate question to Life, Universe and everything.</p>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>M, N</b> \u2264 <b>6</b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>L</b> \u2264 <b>100</b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>Length of each question in List </b> \u2264 <b>6*M*N</b></li>\n</ul>\n<p><br /></p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n3 3\nhas\npps\nine\n5\nfood\nluxury\nmoney\nhappiness\nhappening\n\n<b>Output:</b>\nhappiness\n</pre><h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p>The only word from the list that can be found in the matrix is <b>happiness</b><br />\n(0,0)-->(0,1)-->(1,1)-->(1,0)-->(2,0)-->(2,1)-->(2,2)-->(1,2)-->(0,2)\n</p>\n",
