They lived happily untill one day a strange disease grips the planet. Consider Earth to be built of unit square </p>\n<p>cells infinitely in all the directions. Now the disease has a trigger region consisting of some cells. At any second a cell can have two states, either infected or healthy</p>\n<p>At any second the current state of a cell is determined by the previous states of the four cells directly above, below, and to the side of the cell and the previous state of the current cell. i.e. A total of <b>5</b> cells. If the number of cells infected in the previous second were odd (out of these <b>5</b> cells ) then the current cell will be <b>infected</b>, else it will be <b>Healthy</b>. At every second the rule is applied simultanously to all cells.</p>\n<p>Now Baldy has successfully invented an antidote to the widespread infection. However the formula will only work if he puts in a correct proportion of tetracycline drug in that. There should be exactly <b>one</b> unit of drug for each infected cell. So help baldy find the number of infected cells at the current second.\n</p>\n<p>The infected region initially will be described as a matrix of characters. a cell will have value <b>'i'</b> if it is <b>infected</b>, or <b>'.'</b>if the cell is <b>healthy</b>. You need to find how many cells will be infected at exactly <b>K<sup>th</sup></b>second. <br /><br /><br />\nRead the sample I/O for more clarification.\n</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>\nThe first line will contain an integer <b>T</b>, denoting the number of test cases. for each test case:<br />\n<br />The first line will contain two integers <b>N</b> and <b>M</b> which gives the dimensions of the trigger grid.<br /><br />\nThe next <b>N</b> lines contain a string each of <b>M</b> characters. A character is <b>'.'</b> if the cell is healthy or <b>'i'</b> if it is infected.<br />\nThe next line will contain an integer <b>K</b>.</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>For each test case output the number of infected cells at the <b>K<sup>th</sup></b> second.<br />\nYou can assume the answer will fit in a 64 bit signed integer.<br />\nYou can also assume that the given state of infection is at <b>0<sup>th</sup></b> second.</p>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>T</b> \u2264 <b>100</b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>M*N</b> \u2264 <b>50</b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>K</b> \u2264 <b>10^9</b></li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n\n1\n2 2\nii\ni.\n3\n\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n\n23\n\n</pre><p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p><br />The state of grid at 3rd second will be:</p>\n<p><br />...ii...<br />\n<br />..ii.i..<br />\n<br />.i.iiii.<br />\n<br />iiiii..i<br />\n<br />i.ii....<br />\n<br />.ii.....<br />\n<br />..i.....<br />\n<br />...i....\n</p>\n",
