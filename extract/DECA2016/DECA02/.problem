He has created his army with some divisions. Each division is headed by a leader. Each division has some soldiers.<br />\nWhen the leaders went to Alex to show the army formation, he was unhappy with the number of soldiers in each division. He then decided to increase or decrease<br />\nthe count of soldiers in each division. \"m\" represents the initial count in the division, \"n\" represents the count decided by Alex.</p>\n<p>Only two operations are allowed:<br/><br />\n1. A soldier can be removed from the division, i.e. if there are x soldiers than after operation there will be (x-1) soldiers .<br/><br />\n2. The current number of soldiers can be doubled, i.e. if there are x soldiers than x more soldiers can be added to hav 2x soldiers.<br />\nEach operation cost one.\u00a0</br/></br/></p>\n<p>You have to find the minimum number of operations needed to convert \"m\" soldiers to \"n\" soldiers. See the explaination for more clarification.</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n\n<p>The first line of the input contains an integer <b>T</b> denoting the number of test cases.Each test case consists of one line containing two space separated integers:<b> m</b> and <b>n</b>\n</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>For each test case output the minimum number of operations needed.\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>T</b> \u2264 <b>10^5</b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>m,n</b> \u2264 <b>10^9</b></li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n<p>3\n8 16\n8 5\n1 3</p>\n<b>Output:</b>\n<p>1\n3\n3</p>\n</pre><h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p><b>case 1 :</b>8 can be doubled to 16. so only one operation.</p>\n<p><b>case 2:</b> 3 operations needed :<br />\n\t8->7->6->5. 3 operations.</p>\n<!-- <p><b>case 3:</b>1 doubled to 2,<br/>\n\t2 doubled to 4,<br/>\n\t4 subtracted by 1..</p> --><!-- <p><b>case 3:</b>1 doubled to 2,<br/>\n\t2 doubled to 4,<br/>\n\t4 subtracted by 1..</p> -->",
