Each channel building earns him some bucks.<br />\nSince Alex is not well these days,he requests you to make channels for him so that he can earn maximum number of bucks. </p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n\n<p>The first line of the input contains an integer <b>T</b> denoting the number of test cases.<br />\nEach test case consists of three lines:<br/><br />\nThe first line contains the number of pits 'n' in the lane .<br/><br />\nThe second line contains the positions(x-coordinates) of 'n' pits located in the first lane.<br/><br />\nSimilarly,the third line contains the positions(x-coordinates) of 'n' pits located in the second lane.\n</br/></br/></br/></p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>For each test case output the maximum of channels made.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>T</b> \u2264 <b>10</b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>n</b> \u2264 <b>10^3</b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>value of coordinates</b> \u2264 <b>10^3</b></li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n<p>3\n4\n2  5  8  10\n6  4  1  2\n4\n1 2 3 4\n4 3 2 1\n4\n1 2 3 4\n2 3 4 5\n</p>\n<b>Output:</b>\n<p>2\n1\n4</p>\n</pre><h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p><b>case 1 :</b>channels made will connect the pits loacted at position 8 and 10 in first lane to pits 1 and 2 in the second lane respectively without any blast.</p>\n<p><b>case 2:</b> Of all possible channels i.e. (1,4),(2,3),(3,2) and (4,1) ,at the most any one channel can be made since pits with equal index numbers are connected.</p>\n<p><b>case 3:</b>channels are made between (1,2),(2,3),(3,4)and(4,5) successfully. </p>\n",
