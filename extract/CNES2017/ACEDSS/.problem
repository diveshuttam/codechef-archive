Initially, only some people were infected. Since, everybody have people related to them, so as the time passed, the number of infected persons got raised. At the end, the whole city got infected with the disease. Now, there was a group of people who were researching on the disease, and they want to know the number of initially infected people, in order to figure out the cure.\n<br>\n<b>Constraint:</b> No two people that were initially infected have common relations.\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>First line of input is \u2019T\u2019 - Test cases. Followed by N, the city\u2019s population in the test case (0 to N-1) followed by the number of relations \u2018S\u2019 in the city. Following are 'S' descriptions of type \"a b\" denoting 'a' is related to 'b'. If 'a' is related with 'b' then 'b' is related to 'a'.</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>Output contains t line, the number of people that were initially infected, for each test case.\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<p>0 <= T <= 10<br>\n<b>Subtask1: </b> 2 <= N <= 1000<br>\n<b>Subtask2: </b> 2 <= N <= 100000<br>\n0 <= S <= 100000<br>\n</p>\n\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n2\n\n4\n2\n0 1\n1 2\n\n3\n0\n</pre>\n<pre><b>Output:</b>\n2\n3\n</pre>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p><b>Example case 1.</b> 0 is related to 1; 1 is related to 2; so 0 & 3 will be the answer.<br> \n<p><b>Example case 2.</b> no one is related to anyone. So all were initially infected.\n</p>",
