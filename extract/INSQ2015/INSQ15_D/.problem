    "body": "<span class=\"solution-visible-txt\">All submissions for this problem are available.</span><p>\nVishwas is suffering from sesquipedalophobia i.e. fear of long words. <br />\nVishwas cannot tolerate a string of length greater than <b>K</b>. So Dhruv gave him a long string (containing only characters a,b and c) of length <b>N</b> to annoy him. You being his friend, came to his rescue.You cannot change the length of the string. So you came up with a plan to change some of the characters of the string such that string repeats after every <b>K</b> characters. In other words, now he has to only memorize only first <b>K</b> characters and write them <b>N / K</b> times to form the whole string.\n</p>\n<p>\nFor example:- abcabcabc is  acceptable for K = 3.\n</p>\n<p>\nAs changing characters is a costly process, so you have to complete the process in minimum number of changes.Now you have to output the first <b>K</b> characters of these newly formed repetitive string. If there are multiple answer print the <b>lexicographically smallest string</b>.\n</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\nThe first line of the input contains a pair of integers <b>N</b>, <b>K</b>. <b>N is always divisible by K</b>\n</li>\n<li>\nThe second line contains the string containing only characters a,b and c.\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\nPrint the first <b>K</b> characters which can be formed in minimum number of changes.Also the output should be lexicographically smallest.\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>K,N</b> \u2264 <b>10<sup>6</sup></b></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\nInput #1:\n9 3\nabccbcabc\n\nInput #2:\n4 2\nbacb\n\n<b>Output:</b>\nOutput #1:\nabc\n\nOuput #2:\nba\n\n</pre><p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p>\nIn the first case,we can make the string repetitive after K characters by making 1 change. Change the 4th character to 'a'.<br />\nHence the output is <b>abc</b>.<br />\nOther option is to output <b>cbc</b> but it requires 2 changes.\n</p>\n",
