Mayor of <b>i<sup>th</sup> </b>town charges amount <b>C[i] (1 \u2264 i \u2264 n)</b> for giving permission to change mode of the car.\n<br>\nThese N towns are connected by <b>R</b> bidirectional roads. Initially no mode is set, so you need permissions to set a mode.\n<br>\nYou have to travel from town 1 to N, in minimum amount of cost. Print minimum money required to make the travel. If it is impossible print -1.\n<br>\n<b>Note:</b>\n<br>\n<ul>\n<li>Go up the road mode: when you are at town A and want to go to town B, where H[A] <= H[B]</li>\n<li>Go down the road mode: when you are at town A and want to go to town B, where H[A] >= H[B]</li>\n<li>If you continue with the same mode, you do not need to take permissions from mayor.</li>\n</ul></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>First line contains two space separated integer N and R, number of towns and number of roads.</li>\n<li>Next line contains N space separated integer where i<sup>th</sup> integer is H[i], height of i<sup>th</sup> town.</li>\n<li>Next line contains N space separated integer where i<sup>th</sup> integer is C[i], cost charged by mayor of i<sup>th</sup> town to give permission for changing the mode.</li>\n<li>Next R lines contains two space separated integer u and v, specifying there is a bidirectional road between town u and v.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>Print minimum cost required for travel.
