They were so involved with their conversation that they lost their way  back to home  .  It was already quiet late and so they decided to find a safe place to spend rest of  the night . They found a cave that was big and clean . They thought it was the best place to wait for dawn and then they could easily find their way  back to home . But Alas it was a cave of Gaint \u201cYou know who\u201d . At mid night Gaint , you know who came  back to his cave and caught sifat and his mysterious friend . </p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>  It was Sifat\u2019s good luck or bad luck Gaint \u201cyou know who\u201d was vegetarian but didn\u2019t want to lose the chance to play with sifat and his mysterious friend .  Gaint , \u201cyou know who\u201d used to be a problem  solver so he told sifat that he would give him a sentence \u201cS\u201d and a word \u201cs\u201d . Sifat had to find how many times word \u201cs\u201d occurs as a substring of \u201cS\u201d ( you can safely omit all spaces from the sentence in order to find the substring occurrence ) .  \u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>Input starts with a integer T ( T &lt;= 30 ) , denoting the number of test cases . </p>\n<p>Each case starts with two line . First line contains \u2018S\u2019 and second line contains \u2018s\u2019 . </p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>For each case first print case number and then print number of times s occurs as a substring in S after removing all spaces from S . </p>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b>1</b> &lt;= <b>T</b> &lt;= <b> 30</b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> &lt;= <b> length(S) </b> &lt;= <b> 100000 </b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> &lt;= <b> length(s) </b> &lt;= <b> length(S) </b></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n4\naxb ycz d\nabc\nab  cab cabc abc\nabc\naab acbaa bbaaz\naab\naaaaaa\naa\n\n\n<b>Output:</b> \n\nCase 1: 0\nCase 2: 4\nCase 3: 2\nCase 4: 5\n\n\n</pre><p>\u00a0</p>\n",
