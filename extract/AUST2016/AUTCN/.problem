Few days ago I asked them \u201cTell me something about your software.\u201d. Shovon replied smartly \u201cOh! It\u2019s an android  software . Any person using this software, will know how many vehicles are present in the road at a certain time of period!\u201d Being astonished I asked them \u201cHow do you calculate this?\u201d. This time Hemel answered me, \u201cOur software was pre-loaded with 10^7+1 types of vehicles and they are numbered from 0,1,2,\u2026\u2026,10^7 . Whenever a user connect our software to the internet, the software receives datas from our server. Our server holds the last t (t \u2264 10 ^ 5) seconds data. Each second, an integer is shown which indicates a type of vehicle enters into our server. User can give any number of q (q \u2264 10^5) queries . For each query user need to insert 4 integers t1 , t2 , type1 , type2. Our software returns how many vehicles from type1 to type2 are present from time t1 to time t2.Now the main question is how does our server work? \"But I am not telling you about this. You don't need to know about the theory.\"<br />\nNow I want to build this type of software as quick as possible . I know how the server works. But I don\u2019t know how the software answers the user queries quickly? I need your help to find this.\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>First line contains an integer <b> T (T \u2264 10) </b>, the number of test cases.<br />\nEach case contains a number t, which indicates the server holds information of last t seconds. Next line will contain t integers which means every ith (0 \u2264 i \u2264 t - 1) second, server records an integer<b> k (type of vehicle). Next an integer Q (number of queries) is given . For each query four integers are given t1, t2, type1, type2 (0 \u2264 t1 \u2264 t2 \u2264 t - 1 , 0 \u2264 type1 \u2264 type2 \u2264 10^7) .</b></p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>At first print the test case number . And for each case print the required answer for each query. Follow the I/O formats exactly.</p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n1\n5\n2 2 3 4 5\n2\n1 4 1 5\n0 1  2 30\n\n\n\n<b>Output:</b> \nCase 1:\n4\n2\n\n</pre><p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p><b>Example case 1.</b> For query 1 , there are four vehicles (2,3,4,5) which are recorded in the server from 1st to 4th second. All vehicles types are from 1st type to 5th type . So the answer is 4 .<br />\nFor query 2 , there are two vehicles (2,2) which are recorded in the server from 0th to 1st second. All vehicles types are from 2nd  type to 30th  type . So the answer is 2 .</p>\n",
