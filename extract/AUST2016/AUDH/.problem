    "body": "<span class=\"solution-visible-txt\">All submissions for this problem are available.</span><p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Shibli and Swapnil are two best friends. They study together. Code together. They are planning to go to Jamuna Future Park together. Whatever, that's not the topic.<br />\nSwapnil cannot find his favourite food \"Dabur Honey\". He is suspecting, Shibli took it all during late night coding. But he wants to be sure about it. Here is the amazing way he found out to detect that. As they are coders, they will do it in their own way. Each of them will write a number on a page. Then they will find the number of co-primes each written number has. If Shibli's number has more or equal co-primes than that of Swapnil's then Shibli is not guilty. Otherwise he has to plan an excuse for his action.<br />\nSwapnil is very upset after losing his \"Dabur Honey\" so he cannot code right now. He wants your help to find out whether Shibli is guilty or not.\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>First line will contain a single integer <b> T (T \u2264 100000). </b> T test cases follow.<br />\nEach line will contain two numbers <b> A and B (1 \u2264 A, B \u2264 1000000, A \u2260 B) </b><br />\nA and B are Swapnil and Shibli's written numbers respectively.</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>For each input print one of the lines. \"Swapnil lost it\" if the first case happens. Otherwise, print \"Shibli took it\". Follow the output format exactly.</p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n3\n3 4\n130 114\n120 101\n\n\n<b>Output:</b> \n\nCase 1: Swapnil lost it\nCase 2: Shibli took it\nCase 3: Swapnil lost it\n\n\n</pre><p>\u00a0</p>\n",
