    "body": "<span class=\"solution-visible-txt\">All submissions for this problem are available.</span>You are given a bipartite graph $G = (U, V , E)$, and an integer $K$. $U$ and $V$ are the two bipartitions of the graph such that |$U$| = |$V$| = $N$ , and $E$ is the edge set. The vertices of $U$ are {$1, 2, . . . , N$ } and that of $V$ are {$N + 1, N + 2, . . . , 2N$ }. You need to find out whether the total number of different perfect matchings in $G$ is strictly greater than $K$ or not.\n\nRecall that a perfect matching is a subset of $E$ such that every vertex of the graph belongs to exactly one edge in the subset. Two perfect matchings are considered to be different even if one edge is different.\n\n###Input\n\nFirst line of the input contains three integers: $N$, $M$ and $K$, which represent |$U$| (which is also equal to |$V$|), |$E$| and the queried threshold respectively.\nThe i-th of the next $E$ lines contains two numbers $L_i$ and $R_i$ which denote the i-th edge is between the vertices $L_i$ and $R_i$.\n\n###Output\n\nA single line containing \u201cYes\u201d if the number of perfect matchings is greater than $K$, and \u201cNo\u201d othewise. \n\n###Constraints\n- $1 \\leq N \\leq 100$\n- $1 \\leq M \\leq 600$\n- $0 \\leq K \\leq 10^5$\n- $1 \\leq L_i \\leq N \\lt R_i \\leq 2 * N$\n\n###Subtasks\n\n###Subtask 1 (10 Points): \n- $K = 0$\n\n###Subtask 2 (30 Points): \n- $1 \\leq N \\leq 50$\n- $1 \\leq M \\leq 100$\n- $0 \\leq K \\leq 300$\n\n###Subtask 3 (60 Points):\n- No further constraints.\n\n###Sample Input 1\n\t3 5 2\n\t1 4\n\t2 6\n\t2 5\n\t3 5\n\t3 6\n\n###Sample Output 1\n\tNo\n\n###Sample Input 2\n\t3 5 1\n\t1 4\n\t2 6\n\t2 5\n\t3 5\n\t3 6\n\n###Sample Output 2\n\tYes\n\n###Explanation:\n*Explanation 1:* The graph is as follows:\n\n<img src=\"https://codechef_shared.s3.amazonaws.com/download/upload/IOITC181/Image1.png\" alt=\"drawing\" style=\"width:250px;\"/>\n\nThere are exactly two perfect matchings in this graph: {(1, 4), (2, 5), (3, 6)} and {(1, 4), (2, 6), (3, 5)}. The number of perfect matchings is not $\\gt K$, and hence the output is \u201cNo\u201d.\n\n*Explanation 2:* The graph is the same as previous one, and the same 2 perfect matchings are present. But now, $K$ is 1. Therefore, the number of perfect matchings is > $K$, and hence the output is \u201cYes\u201d.",
