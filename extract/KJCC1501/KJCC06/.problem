There are no obstacles in the maze. Anyone moving through the maze can go either east or south from the current position.<br />\nInitially, Chef and friends are present at (0,0) position of the maze. </p>\n<p>Chef's friend runs into the maze and after reaching at a certain position, he calls Chef and tells his position in the form of x-coordinate <b>'X'</b> and y-coordinate <b>'Y'</b>.<br />\nChef being a nerd starts thinking about the number of ways in which he can reach his friend's position. He wants the answer quickly. Help Chef find the number of ways to reach his friend.</p>\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>\nSingle line containing two space seperated integers <b>'X'</b> and <b>'Y'</b>\n</p>\n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>\nOutput in one line the number of ways to reach Chef's friend\n</p>\n\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>0 \u2264 X \u2264 5000</li>\n<li>0 \u2264 Y \u2264 5000</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Example 1</h3>\n<pre>\n\n<b>Input:</b>\n1 1\n<b>Output:</b>\n2\n</pre>\n<h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p><b><br />\nInitial position : (0,0) <br /><br />\nChef can either go east or south in each move. <br /><br />\nThere are only two ways possible. <br /><br />\nOne way to reach is by first going east and then south. <br /><br />\nSecond way is to first going south and then east. <br /><br />\n</b></p>\n<h3>Example 2</h3>\n<pre>\n\n<b>Input:</b>\n3 0\n<b>Output:</b>\n1\n</pre>\n<h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p><b><br />\nInitial position : (0,0) <br /><br />\nChef can reach his friend only by one way.
