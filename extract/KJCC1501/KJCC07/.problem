Chef has a habit of communicating with friends through encrypted messages. But recently some of his enemies found the way to decrypt and get the original message. You need to write a program that simulates how the enemies decrypted the messages. </p>\n<p>\nChef\u2019s enemies observed that Chef used to first pass <b>N</b> random string before the encrypted message. Afterwards it was noticed that the key to decode the message was hidden in it. The key for decoding was the summation of the values of the <b>key characters</b>. <br /><br />\nKey characters are those characters that appear in all the <b>N</b> strings exactly once (exactly once in each of the N strings). A character cannot be considered as key character if it exists in all <b>N</b> String but does not appear exactly once in any of the string.<br /></p>\n<p>\nOnce all the key characters are found, the key is the summation of the position of all the key characters in the alphabetical series to mod 26. For example, If the key characters are a,b,c then the key is( 1 + 2 + 3 ) % 26 = 6.If there are no key characters then the default value of the key is 7.<br />\n</p>\n<p>\nChef thought finding out this was easy, so he added another twist while encrypting. For all alphabets at index (index starting from 0) which represent a number in Fibonacci Series (0 1 1 2 3 5 and so on), such alphabets were shifted by the key towards right e.g.: a to c, b to d (for key 2). For the rest of  alphabets, they were shifted by the key towards left e.g.: d to b, r to p, a to y (for key 2). Also all the numbers or special characters should appear unchanged.</p>\n<p>Note: All the Strings are in lowercase</p>\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The first line contains a single integer N denoting the N string used for key </p>\n<p>Next N lines are the String</p>\n<p>Next Line is the encrypted Message which needs to be decoded</p>\n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>A single line containing the DECODED string.</p>\n\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>N</b> \u2264 <b>100</b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>| S |</b> \u2264 <b>100</b></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n4\nazfjybgbxnpyatfgcaxqylbxd\ngzbbbgaxnfatxqdjfaypgcyafl\nyjbfpcygxlgznyfbgxtqgxydaaa\nxxyyxxyyxdlbqffctpbngggjz\ncbkumuwlwkmtt_zwksa!!\n<br />\n<b>Output:</b>\nkjscecodecell_rocks!!\n</pre>\n<h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p>\n<b><br />\nHere in the above example, the key characters which exist in all the N strings and appear exactly once in all N strings are 'c', 'd', 'j', 'l', 'n', 'p', \u2019q\u2019, 't', 'z' <br /><br />\nThe key is (3 + 4 + 10 + 12 + 14 + 16 + 17 + 20 + 26) % 26 i.e.  122%26 = 18 <br /><br />\nSo, the encryption key is 18<br /><br />\nThrough this information, we decode the message using opposite steps mentioned in the description. <br /><br />\nOriginal message: kjscecodecell_rocks!! <br /><br />\n</b>\n</p>\n",
