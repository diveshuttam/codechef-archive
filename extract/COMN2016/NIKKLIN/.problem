However, she finds writing story so boring that, after working for three hours, she realized that all she has written are M long words consisting entirely of letters A and B. Having accepted that she will never finish the story in time, Nikki has decided to at least have some fun with it by counting bubbly words.<br />\n\t\t<br /><br /><br />\n\t\t\tNow Nikki is connecting pairs of identical letters (A with A, B with B) by drawing lines above the word. A given word is bubbly if each letter can be connected to exactly one other letter in such a way that no two lines intersect. So here is your task. Help Nikki count how many words are bubbly.</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<li>\n<ol>\n\t\t\tThe first line of input contains the positive integer M, the number of words written down by Nikki.\n\t\t\t\t</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<ol>\n<p>\t\t\tEach of the following M lines contains a single word consisting of letters A and B, with length<br />\n\t\t\tbetween 2 and 10^5, inclusive. The sum of lengths of all words doesn't exceed 10^6.\n\t\t\t\t</p></ol>\n</li>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>\n\t\t\tThe first and only line of output must contain the number of bubbly words.\n\t\t</p>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<li>\n<ol>\n<p>\t\t\t1 \u2264 M \u2264 100\n\t\t\t\t</p></ol>\n</li>\n<h3>Sample Input</h3>\n<p>\n3<br /><br />\nABAB<br /><br />\nAABB<br /><br />\nABBA<br />\n</p>\n<h3>Sample Output</h3>\n<p>2</p>\n<h3>Explanation</h3>\n<li>\n<ol>\n\t\t\t\t\t ABAB - It is not bubbly as A(indexed 1) will connect to A(indexed 3) by a line and when we try to connect B(indexed 2) with B(indexed 4) by a line then it will intersect with the line b/w A and A.\n\t\t\t\t</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<ol>\n\t\t\t\t\tAABB - It is bubbly as line b/w A and A will not intersect with the line b/w B and B.\n\t\t\t</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<ol>\n                                                                   ABBA -It is also bubbly as lines will not intersect. We can draw line b/w A and A above the line b/w B and B.\n\t\t\t\t</ol>\n</li>\n<style> p { text-align:justify } </style>",
