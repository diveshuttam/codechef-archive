Power of figher **i** is given by **P<sub>i</sub>**.\nA fight between two fighters **i** and **j**  is described as below:\n\nThe fight lasts till atleast one of them has non zero power left. \nEach turn is described as below:\n1. Fighter i swings his sword if **P<sub>i</sub>** is not divisible by 2.\n2. Fighter j swings his sword if **P<sub>j</sub>** is not divisible by 2.\n3. No points are awarded if both or none swing their swords. If exactly one of them swings his/her sword, 1 point is awarded to the one who swinged the sword.\n4. Power of each fighter - P<sub>i</sub> and P<sub>j</sub>, becomes *floor*(P<sub>i</sub> / 2) and *floor*(P<sub>j</sub> / 2) respectively.\n\nThe fighter with more number of points at the end of the fight, is awarded with 1 win-point. If it's a draw, both get 0 win-points.\nThen both fighters regain their original powers.\n\nA tournament is organized among these N fighters, where each fighter fights against every other fighter. \nThe one with maximum number of win-points, wins the tournament. Can you tell which fighters would be the winners of the tournament.\n\n*Note*: Multiple people can win the tournament.\n\n### Input\n- First line contains a single integer T - denoting the number of testcases. Each testcase is described by 2 lines.\n- First line of each test case contains a single integer **N**\n- Second line of each test case conatains **N** space seperated integers, where i<sup>th</sup> integer denotes **P<sub>i</sub>**, power of fighter **i**\n\n### Output\n- For each testcase, print 2 lines of output\n- First line contains single integer **k**. (number of winners in the tournament)\n- Second line contains **k** space seperated integers - Powers of the winners of the tournaments in decreasing order of their power.\n\n### Constraints\n- 1 \u2264 **T** \u2264 10\n- 1 \u2264 **N** \u2264 10 <sup>5</sup>\n- 0 \u2264 **P<sub>i</sub>** \u2264 10<sup>18</sup>\n\n### Example Inputs\n2\n\n5 \n\n3 4 5 6 7 \n\n4 \n\n3 4 5 6 \n\n### Example Outputs\n1\n\n7 \n\n3\n\n6 5 3 ",
