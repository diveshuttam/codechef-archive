There is an insanely long bench in the insanely long city of Byteland, which can accomodate **N** people.\n\nThe mayor has to allocate each position on the bench either for a boy or for a girl. \nHe creates an arrangement like \"BBGBGBG..\", where B means seat allocated for boy and G means seat allocated for girl.\nFormally, an arrangement A is a string a of length **N**, where each character is either 'B' or 'G', indicating whether this seat is reserved for a girl or a boy.\nHowever, the kids of Byteland prefer sitting beside a kid of opposite gender. They all collectively formed a pact that they won't sit in an arrangement proposed by mayor, where there are more than **k** consecutive seats occupied by boys or more than **m** consecutive seats occupied by girls or both.\nMayor needs to consider this and come up with a valid arrangement, such that the photoshoot can be conducted.\n\nGiven **N**, **k** and **m**, can you help mayor decide how many different valid seat arrangements are possible. \n\nTwo arrangements **P** and **Q** are considered different if **P<sub>i</sub>** \u2260 **Q<sub>i</sub>** for some **i** \u2208 **[1, N]**\n\n*Note*: Byteland has sufficient amount of both boys and girls (practically infinite for a bench of size **N**) and any arrangement is viable for photoshoot, given the above mentioned concern is addressed.\n \n### Input Format\nFirst line of input contains a single integer T - number of testcases\nEach testcase is described by three space separated integers on a single line - **N**, **k** and **m**\n\n### Output Format\nEach line contains the number of possible arrangements for each testcase. \n\n(Since the answer can be very huge, print the answer modulo 10<sup>9</sup> + 7)\n\n### Constraints\n- 1 \u2264 **T** \u2264 5\n- 1 \u2264 **N** \u2264 10<sup>8</sup>\n- 1 \u2264 **k**, **m** \u2264 32\n\n#### Example Input\n2 \n\n5 5 5 \n\n3 1 1 \n\n3 2 2 \n\n#### Example Output\n32 \n\n2 \n\n6\n\n#### Explanation\n**Testcase 1**: All 2<sup>5</sup> arrangements are possible, since k, m \u2265 n \n\n**Testcase 2**: Only 2 arrangements - **BGB** and **GBG** are possible. \n\n**Testcase 3**: Among all 2<sup>3</sup> arrangements, two are not possible - **BBB** and **GGG**, hence answer is 8 - 2 = 6",
