He is a smart, wealthy and arrogant doctor, unfortunately, the accident leaves his hands un-operable. <br/><br/><br/>\n\nHis colleague and lover <b>Dr. Christine Palmer </b>is trying to heal his hands by various surgeries. This is costing Dr. Stephen most of his fortune and the surgeries are going in vain.  <br/><br/><br/>\n\nBiologically, a gene is a sequence of Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) which codes for a molecule and has a specific function. A DNA is made up of chain of four types of molecules:  adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), and thymine (T). \nThe length of a DNA/gene sequence is N (where N is divisible by 4). \n\n<br/><br/><br/>\nDr. Christine identifies that if the gene sequence is stable/sturdy, it is possible to have him walking again. The sequence is a stable sequence if each of the four letters (A,C,T,G) occurs exactly N/4 times. For example, GACT and AAGTGCCT are stable sequences. \n<br/><br/>\nShe is identifying various gene sequences, which are not necessarily stable. Luckily, she can choose one substring (of zero length also, that is empty) of a gene and replace it with any string of the same length to make the sequence stable. \n\n<br/><br/><br/>\nAltering the gene sequence may be unsafe too. So, she has to find the substring that is of the smallest length which she can choose to replace to make the gene stable. <br/><br/>\n<b>Substring:</b> A substring of a string S is a subsequence made up of zero or more contiguous characters of S. \n<br/><br/><br/>\n<b>###Input:</b>\n<br/>\n- First line will contain an integer N, specifying the length of DNA/gene sequence. Note that its divisible by 4. Also, 4<=N<=2000 (for 50 points) and 4<=N<=500000 (for 100 points).\n<br/><br/>\n- The second line contains a DNA/gene sequence of length N. Note that the gene string will contain a sequence of characters A,C,T,G, without any spaces. Any characters apart from A,C,T,G, are not allowed in a DNA sequence. \n<br/><br/><br/>\n<b>###Output:</b>\n<br/>\nPrint the length of the smallest substring that can be replaced to make the DNA sequence stable. \n\n<br/><br/><br/>\n<b>###Subtasks</b>\n<br/>\n- 50 points : 4<=N<=2000<br/>\n- 100 points : 4<=N<=500000<br/><br/><br/>\n\n\n<b>###Sample Input 1:</b><br/>\n\t8  <br/>\n       GAAATAAA\n\t\n<br/><br/>\n<b>###Sample Output 1:</b><br/>\n\t5<br/><br/>\n\t\n<b>###EXPLANATION 1:</b> <br/>\nReplace AAATA with TTCCG to get: GTTCCGAA (2 G\u2019s, 2 T\u2019s, 2 A\u2019s and 2 C\u2019s).\n<br/>\n<center>OR</center>\n<br/>\nReplace AAATA with GCCTT to get: GGCCTTAA (same). \nHence, smallest possible string to replace that can stabilize the gene is having length 5.  \n<br/><br/><br/>\n\n<b>###Sample Input 2:</b><br/>\n\t8  <br/>\n       GAATTGCC\n\t\n<br/><br/>\n<b>###Sample Output 2:</b><br/>\n\t0<br/><br/>\n\t\n\n<b>###EXPLANATION 2:</b> <br/>\nThe sequence is already stable <br/><br/>",
