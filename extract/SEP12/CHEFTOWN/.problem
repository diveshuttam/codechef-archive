    "body": "<span class=\"solution-visible-txt\">All submissions for this problem are available.</span><p>\nChefTown is the biggest city and the capital of ChefLand. There are N beautiful buildings: restaurants, museums, living houses with large kitchens and so on. Every building has its height. For every i (1<=i<=N) there is exactly one building with height i. The buildings are located in a single line from left to right. The height of ith building is H(i). The Mayor of ChefTown wants to organize a parade, where all great chefs will take part. A parade depends of its location. The location of a parade is a segment of consecutive buildings beginning near the building number L and ending near the building number R (1<=L<=R<=N). Any parade won't be interesting if it is not hold on an interesting segment of buildings. The segment of buildings is interesting if following are hold:\n\n<ul>\n<li>Imagine, that we have a segment [L,R].</li>\n<li>Let K=R-L+1 be the length of this segment, and B be a list of heights of the buildings that belong to this segment.</li>\n<li>Let's sort B in non-decreasing order.</li>\n<li>Segment [L,R] is interesting if B[i]-B[i-1]=1 for every i (2<=i<=K).</li>\n</ul>\n<p></p>\n<p>\nNow the Mayor of ChefTown is interested how many ways to organize an interesting parade of length W for ChefTown citizens. Help him and find out the number of different parades of length W, which can be hold in the city. Two parades ([L1,R1] and [L2,R2]) are considered to be different, if L1&ne;L2 or R1&ne;R2.\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p> Each input file consists of two lines, the first one contains two integers N and W (1<=N<=400000, 1<=W<=N). The second line contains N numbers H(i) (1<=i<=N) - the heights of the buildings. \n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>For each test case output a single integer - the number of interesting segments of buildings of length W.\n\n<h3>Example</h3>\n\n<pre>\n<b>Input 1:</b>\n2 1\n2 1\n<b>Input 2:</b>\n4 2\n1 2 3 4\n\n<b>Output for Input 1:</b>\n2\n<b>Output for Input 2:</b>\n3\n</pre>",
