Note that: begin[i] may be equals to end[i], but he must at least moved to another city during this travel. He can go on one road many times, but it will have a cost for each time.\n<br>\n<br>\nThe cost of this parade is the sum of these items:\n<br>\n1. The sum of costs by traveling on roads. (If a road is passed by k heroes, then it must be count k times.)\n<br>\n2. If for a hero, he ended at a city that not equals to his start city, i.e. begin[i] != end[i], then it will cost <b>C</b> dollars to move him back to his home.\n<br>\n3. If for a city, there is no heroes visited, then we must pay for the citizen <b>C</b> dollars as compensate.\n<br>\n<br>\nThe value of <b>C</b> may change every year, and we can predict this value in the following <b>K</b> years. \nYour task is: calculate the minimal cost of each year.\n<br>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>\nIn the first line, there are 3 integers: <b>N</b>, <b>M</b> and <b>K</b>.\n<br>\nIn the following <b>M</b> lines:\n<br>\nthere will be 3 integers: <b>S[i]</b>, <b>T[i]</b>, and <b>V[i]</b>, describing a directed road from <b>S[i]</b> to <b>T[i]</b>, cost <b>V[i]</b> dollars.\n<br>\nIn the next <b>K</b> lines:\nThere will be an integer: <b>C[i]</b>, describing the value of <b>C</b> in that year.\n<br>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>\nOutput <b>K</b> lines:\neach line contain an integer, corresponding to the minimal cost of each year.\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n2 <= <b>N</b> <= 250\n<br>\n1 <= <b>M</b> <= 30000\n<br>\n1 <= <b>K</b> <= 10000\n<br>\n<b>S</b>[i] != <b>T</b>[i], 1 <= <b>S</b>[i], <b>T</b>[i] <= <b>N</b>\n<br>\n1 <= <b>V</b>[i] <= 10000\n<br>\n1 <= <b>C</b> <= 10000\n<br>\nNote that: there may be more than 1 road between a certain pair of cities.\n\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre>\n<b>Input:</b>\n6 5 3\n1 3 2\n2 3 2\n3 4 2\n4 5 2\n4 6 2\n1\n5\n10\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n6\n21\n32\n</pre>\n<br>\n<b>Explanation</b>\n<br>\nIn the first year, since <b>C</b> is very small, an optimal solution is: no hero travel, we pay 1 dollar for each city as compensate.\n<br>\nIn the second year, an optimal solution is: One hero traveling in the path: 1->3->4->5. We pay 2+2+2=6 dollars for the roads, 5 dollars for taking him back to city 1, and pay 5 dollars for city 2 and 6 as compensate.\n<br>\nIn the third year, one optimal solution is: One hero traveling in the path: 1->3->4->5, and another hero traveling in the path: 2->3->4->6.\n",
