In this game, Lord Gaben presented Harshit with <b>N</b> jars containing some gold each of value <b>A(i) (0<=i<=N-1)</b>. These gold jars are kept on a table sequentially and each jar is connected to a gold deposit by a pipe. The amount of gold that flows into each pipe per second is equal to the initial value of gold in the respective jars and is constant.<br>\nIn this game, Lord Gaben allows Harshit to pick either the leftmost jar or the rightmost jar only every second. There is a catch though, after a jar has been picked up, the gold supply stops for that jar. So at the end of <b>N</b> seconds, Harshit will have picked <b>N</b> jars. The game starts at time=1sec. Since Harshit is very greedy, he wants your help to maximise the amount of gold he can get.\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>First line of the input contains an integer <b>T</b> denoting number of test cases. The description of <b>T</b> test cases follows.<br>\nThe first line of each test cases contains an integer N denoting the number of jars<br>\nNext line of each test case contains <b>N</b> space separated integers denothing the initial amount of gold present in each jar. This is also the amount of gold that flows into the respective jars.</p>\n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>For each test case, output a single integer denoting the maximum amount of gold Harshit can collect.\n</p>\n\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<p>Should contain all the constraints on the input data that you may have. Format it like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>N</b> \u2264 <b>2000</b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>Ai</b> \u2264 <b>1000</b></li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n1\n5\n1 2 3 4 5\n<b>Output:</b>\n55\n</pre>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p><b>Gold supply for each jar is 1 2 3 4 5 respectively.<br>\nAt t=1 the jars contain 1 2 3 4 5 gold each, Harshit decides to choose jar 1, Total=1.<br>\nAt t=2 the jars contain 4 6 8 10 gold each, Harshit decides to choose jar 2, Total=1+4=5.<br>\nAt t=3 the jars contain 9 12 15 gold each, Harshit decides to choose jar 3, Total=5+9=14.<br>\nAt t=4 the jars contain 16 20 gold each, Harshit decides to choose jar 4, Total=14+16=30.<br>\nAt t=5 the jars contain 25 gold each, Harshit decides to choose jar 5, Total=30+25=55.<br>\nTherefore total max gold possible is 55.</b> ...</p>",
