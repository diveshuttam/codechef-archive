    "body": "<p>Dipak's base is being attacked by Chef, and he chooses to hide all his followers by considering their bases as octal and hexadecimal.<br>\nHe has <b>N</b> followers, all of them can be considered as both octal and hexadecimal numbers.<br>\nAt first he considers every follower as an octal number (base 8), and then converting to its decimal form and storing it in an array <b>A</b>.\n<br>\nThen, to confuse the Chef even more, Diapk also considers the original <b>N</b> followers as hexadecimal numbers (base 16), and converts these hexadecimal treated numbers into decimal and joins them to the same array <b>A</b>.<br>\nNow, Dipak wants to find his friend, whose number corresponds to the <b>Kth</b> smallest entry in the converted array <b>A</b>, but all of them are hiding in decimal formats after being treated as octal and hexadecimal numbers.<br>\nGiven the number of followers <b>N</b>, and <b>K</b>, help Chef in finding out who his friend is.<br>\n<b>Note:</b> Each number is converted to decimal after being treated as an octal and a hexadecimal number. Hence for <b>N</b> numbers, the array will have size <b>2*N</b>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>First line contains <b>T</b> number of test cases. Every test cases contains 2 lines as follows:<br>\nFirst line of every test case contains 2 numbers <b>N</b> and <b>K</b>.<br>\nSecond line contains space seperated <b>N</b> numbers.</p>\n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>Output the original number before conversion which corresponds to the <b>Kth</b> smallest entry in the array and the base it was treated as, seperated by a space.</p>\n<p><b>Note:</b> Only if a number has the same decimal representation when treated as octal and hexadecimal, treat the octal number smaller than the hexadecimal number in the sorted array.</p>\n\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>T</b> \u2264 <b>10</b></li>\n<li><b>8</b> \u2264 <b>N</b> \u2264 <b>10^5</b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>K</b> \u2264 <b>2*N</b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>Ai</b> \u2264 <b>10^5</b></li>\nNo digits can have digits larger than 7\n</ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n1\n3 4\n11 22 33\n<b>Output:</b>\n33 8\n</pre>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p><b>11 ,22 ,33 treated as octal equals 9, 18, 27 in decimal respectively.<br>\n11,22,33 treated as hexadecimal equals 17, 34, 51 in decimal respectively.<br>\nThus the final sorted array is: 9,17,18,27,34,51<br>\nThus the 4th smallest entry is 27 => 33 in octal. <br>\nExpected output : 33 8</b></p>",
