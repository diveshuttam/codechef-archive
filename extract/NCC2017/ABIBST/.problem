Each of his ball ornaments are numbered with unique numbers.<br>As Abizer loves Binary Search trees, he plans to sort the balls in a binary tree format. One by one he takes a ball with a particular number and inserts them in the Binary Search tree present on the Christmas tree.<br>\nThe binary search tree has the following properties:<br>\n1) Every node has a higher value node on its right, and a lower value node on its left, unless its a leaf node. (Leaf nodes have no children)<br>\n2) A left node's parent has a higher value than itself, a right node's parent has a lower value than itself.<br>\n3) The root node has no parent and it is always the first node that is inserted.<br>\n<br>\nNumber of balls of the BST (N) and its insertion order will be given to you.<br>\nAssume the leftmost node of the BST is treated as column 0.<br>\nIf a ball belongs to a column X, every ball to its right belongs to a column X+1, and every ball to its left belongs to the column X-1.<br>\n\nIf all the balls are thus given columns this way, if a column is given to you, find the sum of all the values of balls belonging to that column.<br>\n\nColumn numbering is 1-indexed\n</p>\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>First line contains <b>T</b> denoting test cases.<br>\nSecond line contains number of nodes <b>N</b> and number of queries <b>Q</b>. Value of every node is unique.<br>\nThird line contains <b>N</b> space seperated integer values.<br>\nNext <b>Q</b> lines contain a column number <b>C</b>, that isn't out of bounds.</p>\n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>Output the sum of all the nodes present in the column.\n</p>\n\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>T</b> \u2264 <b>100</b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>N</b> \u2264 <b>10^5</b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>Q</b> \u2264 <b>10^5</b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>X</b> \u2264 <b>10^4</b></li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n1\n6 3\n30 20 40 35 10 25\n1\n3\n4\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n10\n90\n40\n</pre>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Explanation</h3>\nView Image for understanding <a href=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/abizerlokhandwala/image/upload/v1488298666/BST_bt5n5z.jpg\">here</a>\n",
