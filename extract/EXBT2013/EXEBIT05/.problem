Once she was taught about the data structure stack in her 10th grade. Amazed by it, she took a sequence of numbers from <i>1</i> to <i>N</i> and tried to generate various permutations of it, by using a stack. She did this by randomizing push and print operations followed by a series of pop operations in the end, over the original sequence by scanning it from left to right. She defined a permutation of a sequence called <i>Stack Generatable Permutation(SGP)</i> as a permutation of a sequence which can be generated by the above procedure. Then it came to her mind, how to figure out quickly whether a permutation of a sequence is an <i>SGP</i> or not and how many <i>SGPs</i> starting from a number <i>K</i> can be obtained from a sequence of numbers ranging from <i>1</i> to <i>N</i> where <i>1&lt;=K&lt;=N</i>. You as a nerd are requested to help her.<br />\n<br/>For example , take <i>N=6</i> i.e. the sequence <i>1,2,3,4,5,6</i>. Now consider its permutation <i>2,4,6,5,3,1</i>. This is an SGP as this can be generated by the following operations, going from left to right:<br/><br/><br />\n<i>push 1 => print 2 => push 3 => print 4 => push 5 => print 6 => pop 5 => pop 3 => pop 1</i><br/><br/><br />\nYou can consider print as an operation resulting from pushing a number to the stack and immediately popping it out.</br/></br/></br/></br/></br/></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The input consists of two parts. In part 1 of the input, the first line contains the number of test cases <i>T1</i>, after which <i>T1</i> test cases follow. Each test case begins with a line containing numbers <i>N</i> and <i>K</i> separated by a single space, where the next <i>K</i> lines(<i>sub-testcases</i>) contains various permutations of the sequence 1 to N where each number in the permutation has a space following it. After <i>T1</i> test cases are done the next line contains the number <i>T2</i> after which <i>T2</i> test cases follow for the second part of the problem. Each test case in the second part contains two space separated numbers <i>N</i> and <i>K</i> in the first line following which next <i>K</i> lines(<i>sub testcases</i>) contain any one of the numbers between <i>1</i> and <i>N</i>.</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>For each test case in the first part of the problem, for each sub test case output 1 in a single line if the permutation is an SGP else output 0. For the second part for each <i>sub test case</i> output the number of SGPs starting from the given number followed by a new line.</p>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>T1,T2,N,K</b> \u2264 <b>50</b></li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n3\n4 3\n1 2 3 4\n3 2 1 4\n2 4 3 1\n3 1\n1 2 3\n6 1\n2 4 6 5 3 1\n2\n4 2\n2\n3\n3 1\n1\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n1\n0\n1\n1\n1\n2\n1\n2\n\n</pre><p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p><b>Example case</b><br/><br />\n3 2 1 4 is not an SGP because POP operations must be done in the end only\n</br/></p>\n",
