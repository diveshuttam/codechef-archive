Any two researchers <i>i</i> and <i>j</i> hate each other if one of the following conditions, holds<br/> </br/></p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Y<i>i</i> >= Y<i>j</i> and P<i>j</i> >= P<i>i</i></b></li>\n<li><b>Y<i>j</i> >= Y<i>i</i> and P<i>i</i> >= P<i>j</i></b>\n</li></ul>\n<p> <br/><br />\nIf both the attributes of a researcher <i>i</i>, are strictly greater than those of researcher <i>j</i>, then <i>i</i> is so eminent for <i>j</i> that <i>i</i> will ignore <i>j</i> and <i>j</i> will respect <i>i</i>.<br />\nThe president of ACM, Mr. X is throwing a party on the occasion of his son graduating as a Ph.D in Computer Science. He has a list of researchers he wants to invite but he doesn't want to invite them all because after a couple of drinks the haters may start heated discussions and hence will spoil the party. So he wants to choose a subset of the researchers such that no two of them hate each other. As his student, help him find how many people he can invite at max.\n</br/></p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>First line of input is the number of researchers <i>n</i> that he knows, after which <i>n</i> lines follow each representing the attributes of a researchers separated by a space i.e. Y P.</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>Single integer i.e. the maximum number of people that can be invited in the party.</p>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b>1 &lt;= n &lt;= 10000</b></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Example 1</h3>\n<pre>\n<b>Input:</b>\n4\n1 4\n2 3\n5 2\n4 3\n<b>Output:</b>\n1\n</pre><h3>Example 2</h3>\n<pre>\n<b>Input:</b>\n6\n2 3\n3 5\n3 7\n4 6\n4 8\n5 7\n<b>Output:</b>\n4\n</pre>",
