Its operating system has a set of jobs <i>JS</i> from an application that it has to execute. A job scheduled to a core runs on that core till its completion. The scheduler is optimized to schedule jobs to different cores such that at the end of execution of <i>JS</i>, the skew of the processing time between both the cores is minimum. For example if there are three jobs <i>A</i>, <i>B</i> and <i>C</i> requiring 2, 3 and 4 milliseconds each respectively, then the scheduler will assign the jobs <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> to Core 1 and job <i>C</i> to Core 2. In this case the skew is |(2+3) - 4| = 1. Yet another scheduling policy can be to assign job <i>A</i> to Core 1 and jobs <i>B</i> and <i>C</i> on Core 2 but in this case the skew will be |2 - (3+4)| = 5, which is not optimal because Core 1 will finish its job in 2 milliseconds and keep sitting idle for five extra milliseconds while Core 2 finishes its jobs in 7 milliseconds. Your task is to find the skew assuming that <br/></br/></p>\n<ol>\n<li>the scheduler optimally schedules the jobs to different cores</li>\n<li>no other job gets allocated a time quantum while any job from <i>JS</i> is executing</li>\n<li>scheduling policy is non-preemptive</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>First line of the input is the number of test cases <i>T</i>, after which <i>T</i> test cases follow. Each test case begins with an integer <i>n</i> in a line, i.e. the number of jobs in <i>JS</i>; followed by burst times(in milliseconds) required for each of the <i>n</i> jobs in a single line with each value separated by single space.\n</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>For each test case output a single integer <i>s</i>, the skew for that test case; followed by a new line character.</p>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b>1&lt;= t &lt;= 10</b></li>\n<li><b>1&lt;= n &lt;= 1000</b></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre>\n<b>Input:</b>\n2\n5\n2 3 4 6 8\n1\n6\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n1\n6  \n</pre>",
