These two teams were those of a 'Triangle's and 'Circle's. Both teams have <b>N</b> candidates each. In direction of resolving this, both teams have provided you with their data for just finding out the areas of each team members.<br />\n<br /><br />\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Input</b><br /><br />\nFirst line contains a single integer N which represents the number of candidates present each team.<br />\nEach of the next N lines contain 10 space separated integers, which are x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, x4, y4, x5, y5 respectively. The first six integers (x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3) represent the vertices of triangle of a candidate of Triangle\u2019s team. The next four integers (x4, y4) and (x5, y5) represent the center of the circle and one of the points on the circumference of the circle of a candidate of Circle\u2019s team.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Output</b><br/><br />\nPrint N lines, each containing two floating point values truncated exactly after two decimal points, the first being the area of the triangle and the second being the area of the circle of the respective candidates corresponding to the respective line in the input.\n</br/></p>\n<p>\n<b>Example Input:</b></p>\n<pre>\n1\n-41 27 88 4 -50 -81 -71 -21 -72 10\n</pre><p><b>Example Output</b></p>\n<pre>\n7069.49 3022.21\n</pre>\n",
