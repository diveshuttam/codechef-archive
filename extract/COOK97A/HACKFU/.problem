For a sequence with even size, the median is the average of the two middle elements of the sequence after sorting. For example, for a sequence $A = [1, 3, 3, 5, 4, 7, 11]$, the median is equal to $4$, and for $A = [2, 3, 4, 5]$, the median is equal to $(3+4)/2 = 3.5$.\n\nFulu is a famous programmer in his country. He wrote the following program (given in pseudocode) for finding the median in a sequence $A$ with length $N$:\n```\nread(N)\nread(A[0], A[1], ..., A[N-1])\nsort(A)\n# simultaneously remove elements A[K] and A[N mod K] from the array A\n# the order of the remaining N-2 elements is unchanged\nremove(A[K], A[N mod K])\nreturn A[(N-2)/2] # integer division\n```\n\nThe program takes an integer $K$ as a parameter. Fulu can choose this integer arbitrarily between $1$ and $N-1$ inclusive.\n\nLittle Lima, Fulu's friend, thinks Fulu's program is wrong (as always). As finding one counterexample would be an easy task for Lima (he has already found the sequence $A = [34, 23, 35, 514]$, which is a counterexample for any $K \\le 3$), Lima decided to make hacking more interesting. Fulu should give him four parameters $S, K, m, M$ (in addition to $N$) and Lima should find the lexicographically smallest *proper* sequence $A$ with length $N$ as a counterexample.\n\nWe say that a sequence $A$ with length $N$ ($0$-indexed) is *proper* if it satisfies the following conditions:\n- it contains only positive integers\n- $A_0 + A_1 +A_2 + \\dots + A_{N-1} = S$\n- $m \\le A_i \\le M$ for each $0 \\le i \\lt N$\n- the number returned by Fulu's program, ran with the given parameter $K$, is different from the correct median of the sequence $A$\n\nCan you help Lima find the lexicographically smallest counterexample or determine that Fulu's program works perfectly for the given parameters?\n\n### Input\n- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.\n- The first and only line of each test case contains five space-separated integers $N$, $S$, $K$, $m$ and $M$.\n\n### Output\nFor each test case, if there is no proper sequence, print a single line containing the integer $-1$; otherwise, print a single line containing $N$ space-separated integers \u2014 the lexicographically smallest proper sequence.\n\n### Constraints\n- $1 \\le T \\le 8$\n- $3 \\le N \\le 10^5$\n- $1 \\le K \\le N-1$\n- $1 \\le S \\le 10^9$\n- $1 \\le m \\le M \\le S$\n\n### Example Input\n```\n2\n3 6 1 1 5\n4 4 2 1 3\n```\n\n### Example Output\n```\n1 1 4\n-1\n```\n\n### Explanation\n**Example case 1:** For the sequence $A = [1, 1, 4]$, it is already sorted, so the program would just remove the first two elements ($K=1$, $N\\%K=0$) and return the only remaining element $4$. Obviously, the median of the original sequence is $1$. It can be shown that there is no lexicographically smaller proper sequence.\n\n**Example case 2:** The only possible sequence is $A = [1, 1, 1, 1]$, which is not proper, since Fulu's program will give the correct answer $1$ for it.\n",
