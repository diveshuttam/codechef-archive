For example, you can find various people with surnames Aggrawal, Agrrawal, Agrawaal, etc. <br /><br />\nMr. Abhishek Agrawal is given some strings. He tries to make the strings resemble his surname and likes it when strings have characters that repeat more than once consecutively.</p>\n<p>\nMore formally, given a string <b>S</b> of length <b>N</b>. He can choose a set <b>T</b>(possibly empty) containing indices of the string <b>S</b>. An index <b>i</b> can belong to the set <b>T</b> if character at the <b>i<sup>th</sup></b> index is not equal to all of its adjacent characters. Help Mr. Agrawal to find the total number of such distinct sets possible.\n</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>\nFirst line of the input contains <b>T</b> denoting number of test cases. Each test case has exactly one line consisting of the input string <b>S</b>.\n</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>For each test case, output the answer in a separate line.</p>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b>1 \u2264 T \u2264 1000</b></li>\n<li><b>1 \u2264 N \u2264 50</b></li>\n<li><b>S</b> consists of lowercase english alphabets</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n\n4\nxy\naaa\nxxyx\na\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n\n4\n1\n4\n2\n</pre><p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p>\nWe will consider a 0-based indexed string here.<br /><br />\n<b>Example case 1:</b> He can choose various sets of indices including {0, 1} , {0}, {1}, {} since each position <b>i</b> in the set does not have they same neighboring character as itself. In total, we can form 4 distinct sets.<br /><br /><br />\n<b>Example case 2:</b> He can not choose any set besides the {} (empty) set. Each index <b>i</b> has the same neighboring character as itself. Hence, it is not possible to include any of the index in any of the set. Hence, answer is 1.\n</p>\n",
