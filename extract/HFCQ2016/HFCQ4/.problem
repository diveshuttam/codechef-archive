He has a kind of strange affinity with strings.<br />\nHe has been trying to solve several problems of strings for quite a while, and got stuck at one of them.</p>\n<p>The problem requires Panda to input two strings <b>A</b> and <b>B</b> each of length <b>N</b> and he needs to make set-A for all substrings of string <b>A</b>, and similarly set-B for all substrings of string <b>B</b> </p>\n<p>His dilemma doesn\u2019t end here. To add the twist to the problem, a value <b>K</b> is also provided to Panda such that he needs to find the answer to four types of queries:-</p>\n<li><b>Type 1: </b>The number of substrings of length <b>K</b> which are both in set-A and in set-B  </li>\n<li><b>Type 2: </b>The number of substrings of length <b>K</b> which are in set-A but not in set-B</li>\n<li><b>Type 3: </b>The number of substrings of length <b>K</b> which are in set-B but not in set-A </li>\n<li><b>Type 4: </b>The number of substrings of length <b>K</b> which are in either set-A or set-B but not in both</li>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>Since, Panda is a weak coder and he needs to solve large number of such queries,   help him to solve this problem.</p>\n<h3>Note</h3>\n<p>The set will always have distinct substrings.</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The first and second lines of the input contain string <b>A</b> and string <b>B</b> respectively.<br />\nThe third line contains an integer <b>Q</b> denoting the number of queries.<br />\nThereafter, <b>Q</b> lines follow where each line is having two values as input in the form of query.</p>\n<p>Each query can be represented as<br /><br />\n<b>X</b>  <b>K</b><br /><br />\nWhere <b>X</b> denotes the type of query<br />\nand <b>K</b> denotes the length of the substrings.</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>For each of the <b>Q</b> queries, you need to output answer on a separate line.</p>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<li><b>1 &lt;= |A|,|B| &lt;= 5 * 10^4</b></li>\n<li><b>1 &lt;= Q &lt;= 10^5</b></li>\n<li><b>1 &lt;= X &lt;= 4</b></li>\n<li><b>1 &lt;= K &lt;= min(|A|,|B|)</b></li>\n<p><br /></p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n\nabab\nbaba\n4\n1  2\n2  4\n3  2\n4  4  \n\n<b>Output:</b>\n\n2\n1\n0\n2\n</pre><p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p>You are provided with strings abab and baba.<br /><br />\nAll possible substrings of A in set 1 are  { a, b, ab,  ba , aba, bab , abab }.<br /><br />\nAll possible substrings of B in set 2 are  { a, b , ab , ba , aba , bab , baba }.<br /><br />\nWe have four queries.<br /> </p>\n<ol>\n<li>First one requires to output the number of substrings of length 2 which are in both set-A and set-B.  We have {ab,ba} as required substrings . The answer is 2.</li>\n<p> <br /></p>\n<li>Second one requires to output the number of substrings of length 4 which are in set-A but not in set-B. We have {abab} as required substring. The answer is 1.</li>\n<p><br /></p>\n<li>Third one requires to output the number of substrings of length 2 which are in set-B but not in set-A.  As, all of 2 length substrings in both the sets are same, the answer is 0.</li>\n<p><br /> </p>\n<li>Fourth one requires to output the number of substrings of length 4 which are in set-A or in set-B but not in both.  We have {abab, baba} as required substrings. The answer is 2.</li>\n</ol>\n",
