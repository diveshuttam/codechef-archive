The beads can be made of either Stone, Glass, Quartz, Ruby or Diamond <strong>(he need not use all five types of beads)</strong> .\n\n\n\nEach bead has a value associated with its beauty as follows\n\n- -2 for Stone\n- -1 for Glass\n-  0 for Quartz \n- 1 for Ruby\n- 2 for Diamond\n\n\nEach bead also has a cost given by <strong> S, G, Q, R</strong> and <strong>D </strong>for the respective bead.\n\nThere are <strong>q</strong> queries for you. In each query chef wants to know the minimum cost for creating a necklace using <strong>exactly X</strong> beads and overall beauty of <strong>Y</strong>.\n\nOverall beauty Y is defined as the sum of beauty of each bead used in the necklace.\n\nSince you\u2019re a great programmer, he wants you to answer each query as soon as possible.\n\n###<strong>Input</strong>\n\nFirst line contains 5 space separated integers <strong>S, G, Q, R, D</strong>, the respective cost of beads.\nNext line contains <strong>q</strong> the number of queries\nnext q lines had two integers <strong>X</strong> and <strong>Y</strong> , the number of beads to be used and the overall beauty\n\n\n###<strong>Output</strong>\n\nfor each query output the answer in a new line\noutput the minimum cost if it exists otherwise print -1\n\n\n\n###Constrains\n\n- $1 \\leq q \\leq 5*10^5$\n- $0 \\leq S, G, Q, R, D \\leq 10^6$\n- $0 \\leq X \\leq 100$\n- $-200 \\leq Y \\leq 200$\n\n\n\n\n###Subtasks\n- 10 points : $0 \\leq X \\leq 2$\n- 20 points : $ q=1 $\n- 70 points : original constrains\t\n\n\n\n###Sample Input\n\n1 2 2 3 4\n\n3\n\n2 0\n\n1 -2\n\n3 6\n\n\n###Sample Output\n\n4\n\n1\n\n12\n\n\n###Explanation\n\nin the first query we can take (stone,diamond), (glass,ruby), (quarts,quarts)\nbut the minimum cost would be if we took quarts and quarts which is <strong>4</strong>\n\nsecond query there is only one way that is to take one stone and the cost is <strong>1</strong>\n\nthird query also there is only one way to take three diamonds and the cost is <strong>12</strong>\n\n",
