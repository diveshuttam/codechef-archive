One of the aims of this monthly contest is to create awareness about the competitive programming and problem solving among the school students. While the focus is on the students in Kerala, anybody who is interested in coding can participate in the contest. The contest is conducted on CodeChef every month. Contest spans over two days \u2013 Saturday midnight through Monday midnight. The contest will focus on problem solving rather than direct implementation of the programming language syntax and built in functions.</li>\r\n<li><b>Organizer: </b>The contest is hosted by Amrita University in association with CodeChef.</li>\r\n<li><b>Registrations for prizes: </b><a href=\"https://goo.gl/W5hP6y\" target=\"_blank\">https://goo.gl/W5hP6y</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</div>\r\n<p><b style=\"color: #444444; font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 23px;\" class=\"rules-heading\">Contest Details:</b></p>\r\n<div class=\"rules-body\">\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>This is an\u00a0<a href=\"https://blog.codechef.com/2017/03/09/a-star-studded-rating-system/\" target=\"_blank\">External Rated Contest</a>.</li>\r\n<li><b>Duration: </b>48 hours</li>\r\n<li><b>Start time: </b>28th\u00a0April 2018, 00:00 hrs IST</li>\r\n<li><b>End time: </b>30th April 2018, 00:00 hrs IST<br /> You may check your timezone <a href=\"https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=CodeChef+-+LoC+April+2018&amp;iso=20180428T00&amp;p1=44\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</div>\r\n<p><b style=\"color: #444444; font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 23px;\" class=\"rules-heading\">Eligibility Criteria: Anyone with a knack for Programming :)</b></p>\r\n<div class=\"rules-body\">\r\n<p style=\"line-height: 23px; font-size: 13px;\">Please go through this\u00a0<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://loc.amrita.ac.in/?page_id=34\">link</a> to know the eligibility criteria.
