    "body": "<span class=\"solution-visible-txt\">All submissions for this problem are available.</span>You are given a $M$ x $M$ grid representing a city. A cell in this grid is represented as $(i,j)$, i.e. the cell at the $i$-th row and $j$-th column in the grid. You own two trucks $A$ and $B$ that deliver goods. Truck $A$ is located at at $(Ax, Ay)$ and Truck $B$ is located at $(Bx, By)$. Both trucks have an infinite number of goods. The two trucks could initially be at the same location.\n\nThe distance to travel between cells $(i_1, j_1)$ and $(i_2, j_2)$ is the Manhattan Distance, i.e.,  $|i_1-i_2| + |j_1-j_2|$ units.\n\nYour company has to serve $N$ orders, where the $i$-th order is located at position $(x_i, y_i)$. An order is said to be served if some truck moves to the location of the $i$-th order. Additionally, the $i$-th order can be served only once all order numbers from 1 to $i-1$ have been served.\n\nWhat is the minimum total distance that the trucks must travel to serve all $N$ orders?\n\n###Input:\n\n- First line will contain $N$, the number of orders to serve.\n- The next line contains 2 space separated integers, $Ax, Ay$, the co-ordinates of truck A\n- The next line contains 2 space separated integers, $Bx, By$, the co-ordinates of truck B\n- $N$ lines lines follow, $i$-th of which contains 2 space separated integers, $(x_i, y_i)$, the location of the $i$-th order.\n\n###Output:\nPrint a single integer, denoting the minimum total distance travelled by the trucks.\n\n###Constraints \n- $1 \\leq N \\leq 5000$\n- $1 \\leq A_x, A_y, B_x, B_y, x_i, y_i \\leq 10^9$\n\n###Subtasks\n- 30 points : $1 \\leq N \\leq 100$ and $1 \\leq A_x, A_y, B_x, B_y, x_i, y_i, \\leq 100$\n- 70 points : original constraints\n\n###Sample Input:\n3  \n3 2  \n4 2  \n2 1  \n2 4  \n2 1  \n\n###Sample Output:\n6\n\t\n###EXPLANATION:\n\nTruck A serves orders 1 and 3 while truck B serves order number 2. Total distance covered by A is 2 units and by B is 4 units. The total distance covered by both trucks combined is 6 units and this is optimal.\n\nOne should keep in mind that order number 3 is not served instantly when truck A arrives at location $(2,1)$. Instead it is served only after both orders 1 and 2 have been served.",
