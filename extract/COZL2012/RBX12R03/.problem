But just a day before the delivery, the company who had taken the contract of packaging the biscuits, changes the cost of all its delivery boxes.\n<p>\nBan-2g Pvt. Ltd. wants to buy boxes which are available in two types, first one costs c1 and can hold n1 biscuits and the second one costs c2 and can hold n2 biscuits. Each box has to be filled to its capacity. You have to find the best way to distribute the biscuits such that total cost is minimized.\n\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>\nThe first line specifies the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line of input specifies the total number of biscuits to be packed. (numbered 1 to 300,000,000).
