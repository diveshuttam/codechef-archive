He travels every morning to meet his friend Ms. Y walking a predefined path.\n<p>\nTo cut the distance short, one day he decides to construct a skywalk from his place to his friend&rsquo;s place. Help him to find the shortest distance between the two residences.\n\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>\nThe first line contains a single positive integer T <= 100, the number of test cases. T test cases follow. The only line of each test case contains a string which is the path from X to Y. The integer value represents the distance. The character R or L represents a Right or a Left respectively.\n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>\nFor each test case, output a single line containing the minimum distance and the direction(N,S,W,E,NE,NW,SE,SW) of Y&rsquo;s residence with respect to X&rsquo;s residence. The output distance should have only 1 decimal place with no approximation. Print &ldquo;0.0&rdquo; if X&rsquo;s and Y&rsquo;s residence coincide.\n\n<h3>Example</h3>\n\n<pre>\n<b>Input:</b>\n1\n2 L 2 R 2 L 1\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n5.0NW\n\n<b>Explanation</b>\nMr. X travels 2units and then takes a Left, and then he travels 2units and takes a Right, then after travelling 2units he takes a Left and finally travels 1unit to reach Y&rsquo;s residence.\n(Unlike Input, Output does not have spaces between the distance and direction)\n\n</pre>\n",
