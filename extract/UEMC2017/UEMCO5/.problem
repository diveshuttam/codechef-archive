Ram with his magical powers arranged the notes present in the book in their original form.</p>\n<p>The entire page of a musical note is in the form of a square matrix of order 'N'.</p>\n<p>Your job is to write a program to simulate the magic so as to recognise the pieces of original position from the torn pieces and revert them back to their original position. It is assumed that there was no wind turbulence in the room, the notes got jumbled up in one certain sequence.</p>\n<p>Ram with his magical powers was not required to detect the sequence though, but you need to find the pattern and help Sita recover her musical notes.</p>\n<p><strong>Input Format:</strong><br />An integer N.<br />A square matrix with binary digits</p>\n<p><strong>Output Format:</strong><br />The original matrix</p>\n<p><br /><strong>Constraints:</strong><br />(1 Digit) &lt;= (Number of binary bits of a number) &lt;= (10 Digits)<br />0 &lt;= N &lt;= 10</p>\n<p><strong>Sample Input:</strong><br />4<br />01101 11011 01110 10100<br />11011 10110 11111 10000<br />10110 01110 10110 11011<br />11011 11001 11000 10011</p>\n<p><strong>Sample Output:</strong><br />01110 11100 10111 11100 <br />11100 10111 01111 11010 <br />01111 00000 10111 11001 <br />10101 10001 11100 10100 </p>",
