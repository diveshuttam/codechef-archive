    "body": "<span class=\"solution-visible-txt\">All submissions for this problem are available.</span><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">When we start dialling a number in our mobile phones, suggestions crop up on the screen from our saved contacts. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Suppose a number is saved as 9433019343, and we start typing 94, then this above number will show up. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Now this seemed too boring to Mr Sinha and he installed a special phone dialler app. This app matches the subsequence typed with all the phone numbers where that subsequence is present. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">For instance, if we write 934 it will display 9433019343 as one of its suggestions since 934 subsequence is present in 9433019343 even though the number doesn&rsquo;t starts with 934. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">But Mr Sinha had a big problem on his hands. His phone&rsquo;s keypad doesn&rsquo;t work and all sorts of mysterious things seem to happen every time he starts typing. Whatever number he presses on the dial pad, some other key or that key itself (if he is lucky enough, not every time though) is taken by the phone and hence the suggestions also gets varied accordingly. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">For example, if he presses 9, then 9 may or may not be accepted. Some random number will be taken. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">After a short research, Mr Sinha with his sheer intelligence came to a conclusion that this random key taken by the phone is following a certain pattern. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Given a no k, the random no generated on pressing the key d (keys are 0-9) will be the first digit of second no of (d+k)&rsquo;th twin prime pair. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Say digit is 1 and k is 1 </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Then (1+1)&rsquo;th i.e 2nd twin prime pair will be (5, 7). </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Now first digit of second no of this pair is 7. So instead of 9, 7 will be registered in and subsequently searched. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Mr Sinha now wants to test your intelligence. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">He will ask you &lsquo;q&rsquo; queries where inputs will be as follows </span></p>\n<ol class=\"ol1\">\n<li class=\"li2\"><span class=\"s1\">Value of n i.e. number of phone numbers in the phonebook </span></li>\n<li class=\"li3\"><span class=\"s1\">An array of size &lsquo;n&rsquo; which will contain n phone numbers&nbsp;</span></li>\n<li class=\"li4\"><span class=\"s1\"> Subsequence &lsquo;s&rsquo; which will be the subsequence or the part of a phone number&nbsp; &nbsp;typed&nbsp; on the screen </span></li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">And finally the value of k with the help of which random number will be calculated. </span></li>\n</ol>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Your mission is to show the numbers that will be shown as suggestions from the contacts. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">If no numbers crop up as suggestions print </span><span class=\"s2\"><strong>No Numbers Match </strong></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>SAMPLE TEST CASE </strong></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Input </strong></span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>1 </strong></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>2 </strong></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>9433019343 </strong></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>9038963278 </strong></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>100 </strong></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>1 </strong></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Output </strong></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>No Numbers Match </strong></span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Explanation: </strong><em>Here the subsequence is 100, and the value of k Is 1.
