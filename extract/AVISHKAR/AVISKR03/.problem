Since trade occurs only along a Y miles stretch of the river, the distance between the first and  the last port must be Y. </p>\n\n<p>To optimize the ship movement between important ports, the distance between any two consecutive ports has been fixed to be within a range of possible distances.\nAlso, distance between two consecutive ports can only be an integer number of miles. </p>\n\n\n<p>As a programmer you have been assigned the job of evaluating the number of different possible arrangements of ports modulo 1000000007.</p>\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>First line of input contains t. The number of test cases. (t<100)</p>\n<p>First line of each test case contains two integers: N, the number of ports (N<=20) and Y, the ditance between the first and the last port. (Y<100000)</p>\n<p>Next (N-1) lines of the test case contains the range of distances between consecutive ports, with ith line giving two integers, the minimum and maximum gap between (i-1)th and ith port.</p>\n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>Print one of output for each test case which is the number of possible arrangements modulo 1000000007.</p>\n\n<h3>Example</h3>\n\n<pre>\n<b>Input:</b>\n1\n2 4\n0 3\n0 3\n\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n3\n</pre>\n",
