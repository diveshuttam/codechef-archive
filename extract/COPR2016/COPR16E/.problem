And how many registered users do you have?\", asked Shagun.<br /><br />\"Only four\", replied Rishab.<br /><br />\"Oh, so please tell us the structure of your network. How many friends does each of your members have? - asked Shagun with some interest.<br /><br />\"One member has three friends, another one has two friends and the two others have only one friend each.\"<br /><br />\"Are you sure?\", asked Garima.<br /><br />\"Yes.\", replied Rishab.<br /><br />To gain some knowledge about the frienship relations, Garima asked,  \"Are the friendship relations reflexive, symmetric and transitive\".<br /><br />Rishab said \"The relationship is symmetric but not transitive and reflexive.\"<br /><br />\"Rishab is a liar\" - said Garima, and neither Garima nor Shagun wanted to talk to him anymore.<br /><br />Over the next few days Rishab was thinking how it was possible that they were so sure that he was lying. He needs your help now<br /><br />Given the number of members of the social network and the data about the number of friends each of them is connected to decide if such a network may exist or not. You are assured that it such a network exists, there will be no multiple connections between any 2 users and no loops exists in the network.<br /><br />For definitions of reflexive, transitive and symmetric, one may refer to<br /><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflexive_relation\">Reflexive</a><br /><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transitive_relation\">Transitive</a><br /><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric_relation\">Symmetric</a></p>\n<h3>Input Contraints:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li> 1 &lt;= t &lt;= 10</li>\n<li> 1 &lt;= n &lt;= 10<sup>5</sup> </li>\n<li> 0 &lt;= a[i] &lt;= 10<sup>6</sup> </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Input Format:</h3>\n<p>The first line contains <b>t</b>, the number of test cases.<br /><br />\n<br />Next t lines contains an integer <b>n</b>, the number of users in the network.<br />Next line contains n spaced integers, where the ith interger denotes the number of friends of the ith user.
