    "body": "<span class=\"solution-visible-txt\">All submissions for this problem are available.</span><p align=\"justify\">Gabbar is back!. He loves numbers which are not divisible by any number other than 1 and number itself. Yes, your guess is correct, he loves <b>primes</b><br /><br />Now, he was given a tough task ahead. He was provided with a number <b>n</b> and was asked it express it as a <b>sum of 1 or more primes</b>. He actually wondered how many ways are there to achieve this configuration. First he thought that this will depend on 2 cases:<br /></p>\n<ol>\n<li>When the order of the primes does not matter.</li>\n<li>When the order of the primes matter.</li>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p align=\"justify\">As <b>Gabbar's friend</b> it is your responsibilty to help him out of the situation. To make your journey tough, <b>Thakur</b> asked you to find the answer to both the cases modulo <b>123456</b></p>\n<h3>Input Contraints:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li> 1 &lt;= t &lt;=  1000 </li>\n<li> 1 &lt;= n &lt;= 5000 </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Input Format:</h3>\n<p>The first line contains <b>t</b>, the number of test cases.<br /><br />\nEach of the next <b>t</b> lines contains an integer <b>n</b> as specified in the question.</p>\n<h3>Output Format:</h3>\n<p align=\"justify\">For each test case, print <b>2</b> space separated integers, the first one denoting the number of ways when the order of the primes does not matter and the second one denoting the number of ways when the order of primes matter. Both the answer should be modulo <b>123456</b></p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n3\n1\n7\n10\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n0 0\n6 3\n16 5\n</pre><h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p align=\"justify\">In the first test case, 1 can only be expressed as sum of 1, which is not a prime. So no possible combination exists.<br />In the second test case, 7 can be expressed as (2,3,2), (7), (5,2) in which order of primes matter. If the order does not matter the first case can be expressed in 3 ways, the second in 1 way and the third in 2 ways, making a total of 6 combinations.<br />For the third test case, 10 can be expressed as (2,3,5), (7,3), (5,5), (2,3,3,2), (2,2,2,2,2) i.e. total of 5 ways in which order of primes does matter. Each of these ways can be expressed in 6, 2, 1, 6, 1 way i.e 16 ways in which order of primes does not matter.</p>\n</ol>",
