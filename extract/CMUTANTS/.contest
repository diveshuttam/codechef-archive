Users will receive one point for solving a problem (passing all test cases - no partial credit), regardless of the level of difficulty of that problem.<br /><br />2. The final ranking is based on the total number of problems solved, ties broken by the total time consumed.<br /><br />3. The total time is the sum of the time consumed for each problem solved. The time consumed for a solved problem is the time elapsed from the beginning of the contest to the submission of the first accepted run plus 20 penalty minutes for every previously rejected run for that problem. There is no time consumed for a problem that is not solved.</span></p>",
