They quickly surveyed the land area and found that some people are living there, and surprisingly the houses are organized in a <b>M</b> x <b>N</b> grid, each cell having exactly one house.</p>\n\n<p>To acquire all the gold beneath this area, the government has planned to make up a rumor ( a volcano is about to erupt near by ) and let the people vacate their houses themselves. They start the rumor at only one house on day 1. It takes exactly one day for the rumor to spread from a house to any of its neighbors ( top, left, bottom, right ). They all vacate their houses as soon as they know about the volcano. </p>\n\n<p> The government wants to choose the starting house for the rumor in such a way that it takes minimum number of days for all the people to vacate their houses. Find this minimum time. </p>\n  \n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The first line contains <b>T</b>, the number of test cases. Each of the next <b>T</b> lines contain two integers <b>M</b> and <b>N</b>. If one of M or N is zero, other one will also be zero, and this means, there are no houses at all.\n\n<p><b>T</b> <= 1,000\n<p>0 <= <b>M</b> <= 1,000,000\n<p>0 <= <b>N</b> <= 1,000,000\n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p> The minimum number of days it takes to spread the rumor to all houses.\n\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre>\n<b>Input:</b>\n2\n1 5\n3 4\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n3\n4\n\n<b>Explanation:</b>\nCase 1 : Starting cell (1,3)\nCase 2 : See the following table with a possible answer, each cell has the first day in which they hear the rumor.\n<table>\n<tr> <td>3</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>4</td></tr>\n<tr> <td>2</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td></tr>\n<tr> <td>3</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>4</td></tr>\n</table>\n</pre>\n",
