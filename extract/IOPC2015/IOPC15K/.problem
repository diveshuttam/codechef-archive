For real gases, we have Vander-Waals Equation. Inspired from these, nowadays, Churu is doing research on <b>Imaginary Gases</b> and found many interesting equations and criteria for Imaginary Gases.</p>\n<p> He performs all the experiments in his lab, which can be represented as a cuboid of dimension - <b>X x Y x Z </b>. Co-ordinate system  is standard 3-dimentional Cartesian co-ordinate system. Co-ordinate of the (bottommost, leftmost, front) point is (0,0,0). As we move right X-cordinate increases. As we move up Z-cordinate increases. As we move away Y-cordinate increases. Moreover, he has recently published a paper on Imaginary gases, according to which Imaginary gases have the following properties - </p>\n<ul>\n<li> Imaginary Gases are made up of very tiny particles. It is quite safe to assume that they are point sized. That means it is possible to observe more than one particle at a point at the same time.\n</li><li> These particles move randomly inside the container in which they are kept. The probability of finding a particular particle at any point inside the container is equal. Note that in this problem we will only focus on<b> points with Integer co-ordinates</b>.\n</li><li> Mass of all gas particles is same, which is universal constant.\n</li><li> Collision between these particles is perfectly elastic.\n</li><li> Partcles are very rigid. That means they do not break while collision happens.\n</li><li> These particles posses potential energy by virtue of <b>C-field</b> (C for <b>C</b>huru, just like Electric field or magnetic field, there is C-field).\n</li><li> If value of C-field at a point is <b>c<sub>0</sub></b>, then the potential energy of any Imaginary gas particle will be <b>p<sub>e</sub> = K<sub>c</sub> * c<sub>0</sub></b> (K<sub>c</sub> greater than 0). Where K<sub>c</sub> is called Churu constant, is universal constant.\n</li><li> If a container containes <b>Ni</b> gas particles, then <b>total potential energy (P<sub>tot</sub>)</b> due to all the particles will be sum of the <b>average</b> potential energies due to all the individual particles.\n</li><li> <b>Total Energy</b> of all those particles will be <br /> <center><b>E = K<sub>k</sub> * P<sub>tot</sub><sup>(d - k)</sup></b>. </center><br /><br />\nWhere <b>d</b> is a constant which will be given in the input. And <b>k</b> depends on the co-ordinates of the container, where it is kept ! K<sub>k</sub> is universal constant. K<sub>k</sub> is greater than 0.\n</li><li> In this question, you will be given the dimensions of a cuboidal container (<b>L<sub>c</sub> x B<sub>c</sub> x H<sub>c</sub> </b>) containing Imaginary Gas. And a cuboidal region will also be given. You will need to find the most stable location for the container completely inside the given region.\n</li><li> If we want to find the most stable location for the container inside the region <b>(x<sub>mn</sub>, y<sub>mn</sub>, z<sub>mn</sub>)</b> to <b>(x<sub>mx</sub>, y<sub>mx</sub>, z<sub>mx</sub>)</b> [Both inclusive], then <br /> <center><b> k = (x<sub>mn</sub> + y<sub>mn</sub> + z<sub>mn</sub> + x<sub>mx</sub> + y<sub>mx</sub> +z<sub>mx</sub>) / 6.0 </b>. </center> <br /> Note that, (x<sub>mn</sub> \u2264 x<sub>mx</sub>, y<sub>mn</sub> \u2264 y<sub>mx</sub>, z<sub>mn</sub> \u2264 z<sub>mx</sub>).\n</li><li> A container containing Imaginary gas is more stable if it has less Total Energy. So, if such container is left to float in a region, then it will stop at a location where total energy is minimum. As we all know, this low-energy stability is seen many times in physics, so it follws here as well !\n</li></ul>\n\n<p>\nIn this problem you will be given the dimension of the room (<b>X, Y, Z </b>) and the dimension of the container (<b>L<sub>c</sub>, B<sub>c</sub>, H<sub>c</sub> </b>) and the constant <b>d</b>. You will also be given an integer, <b>D</b>. Also the value of <b>C-field</b> at all the points in Churu's lab will be given (Integer points). Then there will be several queries. Each query will be contaning three space separated integers, <b> Xq, Yq</b> and <b>Zq </b>. For each query you will need to find the best location for the container to be kept inside the cuboidal region - (<b> Xq, Yq, Zq </b>) to (<b> Xq + D - 1, Yq + D - 1, Zq + D - 1 </b>) [Both Inclusive]. By best location Churu means, location which is most stable. Formally, for each query you need to find co-ordinates of a point (<b> Xr, Yr, Zr </b>). such that if the container is kept such that its <b>(x<sub>mn</sub>, y<sub>mn</sub>, z<sub>mn</sub>)</b> coincides with this point, its total energy will be minimum. Note that container should be completely inside (touching the boudry is allowed) the allowed region - (<b> Xq, Yq, Zq </b>) to (<b> Xq + D - 1, Yq + D - 1, Zq + D - 1 </b>) [Both Inclusive]. Also note that container can only be translated and can't be rotated which means, <b>L<sub>c</sub> </b> should be parallel to <b>X</b>-axis, <b>B<sub>c</sub> </b> should be parallel to <b>Y</b>-axis and <b>H<sub>c</sub> </b> should be parallel to <b>Z</b>-axis. You need to report (<b> Xr, Yr, Zr </b>). If there are many such points which give same stability then, report the one with least <b>X</b> co-ordinate. If there are still many then report the one with least <b>Y</b>. If there are still many, then report the one with least <b>Z</b>.\n</p>\n<p>\nSince the dimension of the room can be large, value of <b>C-field</b> at all the points can not be given as input. However, value of <b>C-field</b> at <b>Q</b> particular points will be given. And Value of <b>C-field</b> at all other points will can be calculated by the formula - <br /><center><b>C<sub>x,y,z</sub> = (x * x + y * y + z * z + Num) % P</b> at point (x, y, z).</center><br /> Value of <b>Num</b> and <b>P</b> and <b>Q</b> will also be given in the input. <b>Please note that this function is nothing special. It is just for avoiding huge Input size.</b>\n</p>\n<p>\nContainer / Churu's lab can be thought as a grid (3 - dimensional). Example, X = 1, Y= 2,  Z = 3, represents a grid containing 1 * 2 * 3 = 6 points. Also, since a gas particle can be seen anywhere in the container with equal probability, average potential energy will be equal to, assuming a gas particle at each point and  sum the potential energies at all the points then divide by number of points inside the container.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Please note that we only consider points with integer cordinates in this problem everywhere. Whenever point  is written anywhere, it means point with integer co-ordinates. </b>\n</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>First line of the input contains three space separated integers <b>X, Y, Z </b>, in order, denoting the dimension of Churu's lab.</li>\n<li>Next line contains three space separated integers <b>L<sub>c</sub>, B<sub>c</sub>, H<sub>c</sub> </b>, in order, denoting the dimension of the container.</li>\n<li>Next line contains three space separated integers <b> P </b>, <b>Q</b> and <b>Num</b>respectively.

Note that this is <b>not an integer</b>! However, (d * 100) will be integer, which means there will be atmost 2 significant digits after the decimal point in decimal representation of d.</li>\n<li>Next line contains two space separated integers <b>D</b> and <b>queries</b> respectively. <b>D</b> is already described in the problem statement.
