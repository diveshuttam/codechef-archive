He told that given a rooted tree <b>T</b> containing <b>N</b> nodes, numbered from <b>1</b> to <b>N</b>, rooted at node <b>1</b>. Pre-order array of the tree can be obtained by doing pre-order depth first search on the tree, starting from node <b>1</b> and recursively visiting the subtrees rooted at the children of the root. For example, given a tree containing 5 nodes and following pair of nodes are connected via direct edge -\n<ul>\n<li> 1 2\n</li><li> 1 3\n</li><li> 2 4\n</li><li> 2 5</li></ul>\n</p><p>then pre order array can be -  1 2 4 5 3.<br /> Clearly there are many possible pre-order array for a given tree. e.g, (1 3 2 5 4) is also a valid pre order array for the given tree. Then Abhinav told little Shark that all the nodes in the subtree rooted at a node, say <b>nd</b> appears consecutively in the pre-order array ! For example, nodes in the subtree rooted at <b>nd = 2</b> in the given example are 2, 4 and 5. Clearly these numbers appears consecutively in the pre-order array starting at index 2 (1 based index). This is true for any pre-order array for the tree. You may verify that.</p>\n<p>\nLittle Shark got the point Abhinav was trying to make. But after pondering over the concept for some time he asked Abhinav can we recover the tree if pre-order array is given !<br />\n\u00a0</p>\n<p>\nIn this problem you will be given pre-order array of a tree and some clues about some of the subtrees of the tree. You need to find a tree satisfying the given clues and has at least one pre-order traversal as given in the input.\n</p>\n<p>\nClues will be given in the from three integers <b>nd, l</b> and <b>r </b>. Denoting that nodes of the subtree rooted at node <b>nd</b> lies consecutively in the given pre-order array from index <b>l</b> to <b>r</b>. Can you find the tree ?\n</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The first line of the input contains a single integer <b>N</b> denoting the size of the tree (size of the pre-order array). The second line contains <b>N</b> space-separated integers denoting the elements of the pre-order array.</li>\n<li>Next line contains an integer <b>Q</b> denoting the number of clues given.</li>\n<li>Next Q lines each contains three space separated integers denoting <b>nd, l and r</b> respectively as described in the problem statement. </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>First line of the output should contain an integer <b>f</b>. If there is no such tree satisfying all the clues, then f should be equal to 0. Otherwise it should be equal to 1.</li>\n<li>If <b>f = 1</b> then in next <b>N-1</b> lines print the edges of the tree. Each line should contain two integers <b>u and v</b> denoting there is direct edge between node u and node v in the tree. Output must satisfy a valid tree structure.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>N</b> \u2264 <b>100000</b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>Q</b> \u2264 <b>100000</b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>nd</b> \u2264 <b>N</b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>l  \u2264 r </b> \u2264 <b>N</b></li>\n<li>Elements of the preorder array will be between 1 and N (both inclusive).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n4\n1 2 3 4\n4\n1 1 4\n2 2 4\n3 3 4\n4 4 4\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n1\n1 2\n2 3\n3 4\n\n</pre>",
