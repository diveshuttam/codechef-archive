He has a very superstitious belief that when you toss a coin, <b>heads</b> is more likely to appear. Maggi tries to explain him that his claim is completely wrong as the coins are unbiased and both <b>heads</b> and <b>tails</b> are equally likely to appear.</p>\n<p>To prove her claim, Maggi starts a coin tossing experiment. She tosses an unbiased coin many times. She keeps tossing the coin till she gets <b>K more heads</b> than tails. Meanwhile at each step she also records (number of tails - number of heads) that have appeared till that step. At the end of the experiment she reports the maximum of her recorded values. She believes that this value will be closer to <b>K</b> as the coin is unbiased, whereas Modi believes that this value will be much smaller than <b>K</b>. Also Maggi gets frustrated very quickly and whenever during the experiment number of <b>tails is X more than</b> number of heads she accepts her defeat and stops the experiment.</p>\n<p>Maggi does not want to lose, so she comes to you for help. She wants to know the expected value of the number she reports at the end of the experiment.</p>\n<p>Note:This reported value cannot be negative as at the start total number of heads and tails that have appeared is zero.</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The first line of the input contains an integer <b>T</b> denoting the number of test cases. The description of <b>T</b> test cases follows.</li>\n<li>Each test case consists two integers <b>K</b> and <b>X</b> as described in the problem statement</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>For each test case, output a single line containing the expected value of number reported by Maggi correct upto 6 decimal places. </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>T</b> \u2264 <b>100</b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>K</b> \u2264 <b>100000</b></li>\n<li><b>0</b> \u2264 <b>X</b> \u2264 <b>100000</b></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n2\n4 0\n4 1\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n0.000000\n0.800000\n</pre>",
