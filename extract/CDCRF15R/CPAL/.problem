It is ensured that <b>t1</b> and <b>t2</b> are valid times.\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Each output on a new line.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b>1 \u2264 q \u2264 10<sup>5</sup></b></li>\n<li><b>t1</b> and <b>t2</b> are of the form HH:MM:SS</li>\n<li><b>t1</b> occurs on or before <b>t2</b></li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n4\n00:00:01 00:00:01\n09:09:09 13:34:57\n11:11:11 11:11:11\n02:38:15 03:01:16\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n0\n22\n1\n3\n</pre><p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p><b>Case 1:</b> Only 1 moment is considered in this case, i.e., 00:00:01. We can clearly see that 00:00:01 is not a palindromic string.<br /><br />\n<b>Case 4:</b> Between 02:38:15 and 03:01:16, there are 3 moments that are palindromic strings. They are 02:44:20, 02:55:20 and 03:00:30.\n</p>\n<p><br /><br />\n<b>Note</b> that the time as seen on a digital clock should appear as a palindrome. 1 is a palindrome, but 00:00:01 on a digital clock is not.</p>\n",
