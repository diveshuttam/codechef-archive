He has created his own spin-off of a Bowling Alley. </p>\n<p>He takes a rectangular area of edge mxn. This rectangle has mxn cells in it. Each cell may have either a bumper or a bowling pin.<br />\nThe ball may be rolled in any of the Four directions(input uses this notation 0=north, 1=east, 2=south, 3=west,) with any speed. Calculate the points scored subject to the following rules:<br />\n<br /><br />\n1) Every bowling pin dropped, reduces the ball's speed by 1<br />\n<br />2) When the ball hits a bumper, it's speed reduces by 1.5 and it changes direction to the right of the direction it was originally travelling in.<br />\n<br />3) If the ball hits the edge of the rectangle, it rebounds back in the opposite direction with the same velocity.<br />\n<br />4) The Bowling Pin falls, only the first time the ball passes through that cell.<br />\n<br />5) Each Bowling Pin is worth 1 point. Each Bumper is assigned a set of points for its worth.<br />\n<br />6)If there's no pin or bumper in the cell, the ball speed reduces by 0.5 . </p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>\nThe first line contains the horizontal length (n), vertical length (m) of the rectangle ,the number of bumpers (q) and number of balls(w). (n m q w)<br />\n<br />The next q lines take the space separated input of the location of bumpers and their points. (X Y Points)<br />\n<br />The next w lines take a space separated input of location of balls, starting direction and speed. (X Y DIRECTION SPEED)</p>\n<p>The w balls are played sequentially after resetting the Alley at the end of the last ball. </p>\n<p>Only speed is taken as float value, rest all data type is integer type.</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p> The score of each ball on a new line (totally w lines). </p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre>\n<b>Input:\n5 4 5 3\n1 0 2\n0 3 1\n4 3 3\n3 2 1\n2 1 2\n3 3 0 20\n4 3 3 25\n1 0 0 10\n</b>\n\n\n<b>Output:\n13\n25\n10\n\n</b>\n\n</pre>",
