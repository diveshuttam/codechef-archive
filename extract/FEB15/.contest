At CodeChef, we work hard to revive the geek in you by hosting a programming contest at the start of the month and another smaller programming challenge in the middle of the month.</p> </div> <p><br /> <b class=\"rules-heading\">About CodeChef February Long Challenge:</b></p> <div class=\"rules-body\"> <p>CodeChef Long Challenge is a 10 day monthly coding contest where you can show off your computer programming skills. The significance being - it gives you enough time to think about a problem, try different ways of attacking the problem, read the concepts etc. If you\u2019re usually slow at solving problems and have ample time at hand, this is ideal for you. We also put in a lot of efforts in getting quality problems, which would in turn foster your learning while solving them.</p> </div> <p><br /> <b class=\"rules-heading\">Contest Details:</b></p> <div class=\"rules-body\"> <ul class=\"\"> <li><b>Problem Setters: </b><a href=\"/users/berezin\">Dmytro Berezin</a>, <a href=\"/users/antoniuk1\">Vasia Antoniuk</a>, <a href=\"/users/super_sonic\">Sunny Aggarwal</a>, <a href=\"/users/dpraveen\">Praveen Dhinwa</a>, <a href=\"/users/malinovsky239\">Ilya Malinovsk</a>, <a href=\"/users/kevinsogo\">Kevin Charles Atienza</a>, <a href=\"/users/alex_2oo8\">Alexey Zayakin</a>, <a href=\"/users/chandubaba\">Chao Chandan Boruah</a>, <a href=\"/users/abhra73\">Abhra Dasgupta</a>.</li> <li><b>Problem Tester: </b><a href=\"/users/shangjingbo\">Jingbo Shang</a> and <a href=\"/users/pushkarmishra\">Pushkar Mishra</a></li> <li><b>Editorialist: </b><a href=\"/users/elfus\">Florin Elfus</a></li> <li><b>Russian Translator: </b><a href=\"/users/gomelfk\">Fedor Korobeinikov</a></li> <li><b>Mandarin Translator: </b><a href=\"/users/stzgd\">Gedi Zheng</a></li> <li><b>Duration: </b>10 Days, From 6<sup>th</sup> February 15:00 hrs IST to 16<sup>th</sup> February 15:00 hrs IST.\u00a0Check your timezone\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=CodeChef%3A+February+Challenge+2015&amp;iso=20150206T15&amp;p1=44\">here</a>.</li> <li><b>For ranklist visit: </b><a href=\"/rankings/FEB15\">http://www.codechef.com/rankings/FEB15</a></li> </ul> </div> <p><b class=\"rules-heading\">Eligibility Criteria: Anyone with a knack for Programming :P</b></p> <div class=\"rules-body\"> <p>Our contests are open to all the programmers across the globe.</p> </div> <p>\u00a0</p> <p><b class=\"rules-heading\">What's in it for you?</b></p> <div class=\"rules-body\"> <p>The idea behind these programming contests is that we want you to learn while competing. Also we believe that it is alright to refer to tutorials, books and other materials, learn a concept and then apply the same to solve a problem during a contest. But it is <b>not alright to copy other people's solutions or seek other people's help to solve a problem without understanding it.</b> The dividing line may seem to be thin but it can be captured by the spirit of learning. If whatever you are doing is making you learn while you do so, we tend to believe that it is alright. However, all the participants are expected to abide to\u00a0<a href=\"http://discuss.codechef.com/questions/18662/does-codechef-have-any-code-of-conduct\">CodeChef Code Of Conduct</a>.</p> <br /> <p>Not just that, as a token of motivation we also give away cash prizes and goodies to the winners of the contest. You can know more about prizes <a href=\"http://discuss.codechef.com/questions/51999/how-do-i-win-a-codechef-goodie\">here</a>. However, our sole intention lies in making our users learn new concepts while competing.</p> </div> <p><br /> <b class=\"rules-heading\">What\u2019s new in CodeChef?</b></p> <div class=\"rules-body\"> <p>You may now play with our new <a href=\"http://blog.codechef.com/2015/02/04/play-more-in-discuss-with-groups-latex/\">groups &amp; LaTex feature</a> on discuss.</p> </div> <p><br /> <b class=\"rules-heading\">Rules and Regulations:</b></p> <ul class=\"\"> <li>Please do not discuss strategy, suggestions or tips in the comments during a live contest.

If you have, then do let us know, so that we can deactivate the insignificant one. If you do not report it and we come to know about it, we may deactivate both the accounts permanently.</li> <li>The score that you will see during the contest (for tie-breaker problem), will only be partial (obtained on 20% of the test data). The submissions will be re-judged at the end of the contest to get full score (obtained on the whole test data).</li> <li>The number of submissions that one can make during the contest on the problem will be limited to 500.</li> <div class=\"rules-body\"><b>Note: You can now \"Code, Compile, and Run\" your codes on our newly launched <a href=\"/ide\">Online IDE</a>.</b></div> <div class=\"rules-body\">However, if you are using any other online development environment, make sure that other contestants don't have access to your code.
