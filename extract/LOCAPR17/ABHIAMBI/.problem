The game is played over <b>N</b> piles of coins with each pile having <b>A</b> coins. It is given that <b>A</b> is <b>Prime</b>. The game is played according to some rules.\n<br>\n<br>\n1. Each player in his turn can choose a pile of coins and remove some <b>X>0</b> number of coins from the chosen pile.\n<br>\n<br>\n2. The number <b>X</b> chosen should be such that <b>X</b> number of coins were not removed in any of the previous moves from any of the piles . For example , if a player removes 3 coins from a certain pile in his turn , no player can remove 3 coins from any pile in any of the successive turns.\n<br>\n<br>\n3. <b>Abhi</b> always goes first.The players play in alternating turns. It is given that both players play optimally. The player who can't move in his turn loses. For every test case , print <b>\u201cAbhi\u201d</b> if Abhi wins and <b>\u201cAmbi\u201d</b> otherwise.\n<br>\n</p>\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The first line contains an integer <b>T</b>, total number of testcases. Then follow T lines, each line contains <b>N</b> and <b>A</b> respectively as described above.</p>\n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>For every test case print the winner's name in a new line.</p>\n\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>T</b> \u2264 <b>10^5</b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>N</b> \u2264 <b>10^5</b></li>\n<li><b>2</b> \u2264 <b>A</b> \u2264 <b>10^9</b> (<b>A</b> wiil be prime)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Subtasks</h3>\n<b>Subtask #1 (20 points), Time limit : 1 sec<br>\n1 \u2264 T \u2264 100000, 1 \u2264 N \u2264 10^5 , 2 \u2264 A \u2264 N (A is prime)</b><br><br><br>\n<b>Subtask #2 (80 points), Time limit : 1 sec<br>\n1 \u2264 T \u2264 100000, 1 \u2264 N \u2264 10^5, 2 \u2264 A \u2264 10^9 (A is prime) </b>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b> \n\n2\n1 2\n2 2\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n\nAbhi\nAmbi\n</pre>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p> In the sample input 1, there is a single pile of 2 coins.
