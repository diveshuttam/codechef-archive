Below are few basic details of Test cricket.</p>\n<ul>\n<li> Test cricket is played over <b>5</b> days. Each day having <b>90</b> overs. </li>\n<li> Each over consist of <b>6</b> balls. Suppose we are in <b>21<sup>st</sup></b> over, all <b>6</b> balls will be represented as <b>20.1, 20.2, 20.3, 20.4, 20.5, 20.6</b> </li> \n<li> Decision Review System(DRS) is available to team to challenge umpire's decision. Initially each team has <b>2</b> reviews. Every unsuccessful use of DRS deducts <b>1</b> review whereas successful use of DRS doesn't cause any deduction from remaining chances. </li>\n<li>After every <b>80</b> overs (i.e. after 79.6, 159.6 and so on), number of chance to use DRS are set to <b>2</b> for each team. </li> </ul>\nQuite unexpectedly team India batted for all <b>5</b> days. They had to use many reviews as umpire's are human being and bound to make mistakes. Can you tell in worst case how many reviews used by India may have gone unsuccessful? You may assume that there infinite number of batsman in team.\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The first line of the input contains an integer <b>T</b> denoting the number of test cases. The description of <b>T</b> test cases follows.</li>\n<li>The first line of each test case contains a single integer <b>N</b> denoting the number of reviews used. </li>\n<li> Each of next <b>N</b> lines contain a ball number of the form <b>O.B</b>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>For each test case, output a single line containing the maximum number of unsuccessful reviews made .</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<h3>Subtask 1 (20 points)</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>T</b> \u2264 <b>100</b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>N</b> \u2264 <b>80*6</b></li></li>\n<li> <b>0</b> <= <b>O</b> < <b>80</b></li>\n<li> <b>1</b> <=<b>B</b> <= <b>6</b>\n</ul>\n<h3>Subtask 2 (80 points)</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>T</b> \u2264 <b>100</b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>N</b> \u2264 <b>5*90*6</b></li>\n<li> <b>0</b> <= <b>O</b> < <b>5 * 90</b></li>\n<li> <b>1</b> <=<b>B</b> <= <b>6</b>\n</ul>\nYou may assume that all the balls are given in strictly increasing order\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n2\n2\n10.5\n19.6\n3\n0.5\n75.6\n83.4\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n2\n3\n</pre>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p><b>Example case 1.</b> Initially there are 2 reviews available. Team India uses review on 10.5 ball and it is unsuccessful. Now there is 1 review available. Now again review made on 19.6 ball is unsuccessful. Review remaining is 0. Number of unsuccessful review made is 2. </p>\n<p><b>Example case 2.</b> Initially there are 2 reviews available. Team India uses review on 0.5 and 75.6 ball and  both are unsuccessful. Now review remaining is 0. After 80 over (i.e after 79.6 ball) reviews are set to 2. Again team India uses review on 83.4 ball and it is also unsuccessful. Review available is 1 and number of unsuccessful review made = 3.\n</p>",
