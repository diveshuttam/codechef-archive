The presents are packed in gift packs, <b>x</b> presents in each. The chef will take to his chopper exactly a<sub>1</sub>+...+a<sub>n</sub> gift packs.</p>\n\n<p>As the chef goes in the<b> i<sup>th</sup> </b>city, he takes <b>a<sub>i</sub> </b>gift packs and goes out. On the first day in the city the chef gets to know the citizens. On the second and all subsequent days the chef gives presents to the citizens \u2014 each of the <b>b<sub>i</sub></b> citizens gets one present per day. The chef leaves the city in the evening of the day when the number of presents left is strictly less than the number of citizens. He throws away the remaining presents.</p>\n\n<p>The Chef will spend exactly <b>c</b> days traveling. The time spent in chopper between the cities is considered to be negligible. In how many ways can one choose the positive integer <b>x</b> so that the planned event will take exactly<b> c</b> days?</p>\n\n<h3>Input:</h3>\n<p>The First line contains Single Integer <b>T</b>, the number of test cases. <br>The Second line contains space-separated integers n and c.\n<br>The next n lines contain pairs of space-separated integers a<sub>i</sub>,b<sub>i</sub> (1 \u2264 i \u2264 n) \u2014 the number of giftpacks he can bring to the i-th city and the number of citizens of the i<sup>th</sup> city.\n</p>\n\n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>Print a single number k \u2014 the number of ways to choose x so as to travel for exactly c days. If there are infinitely many possible values of x, print -1.</p>\n\n<br>\n\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>T</b> \u2264 <b>10</b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>N</b> \u2264 <b>10000</b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>a<sub>i</sub> , b<sub>i</sub></b>  , <b>c</b> \u2264 <b>10<sup>9</sup></b></li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p><br></p>\n<h3>Subtasks</h3>\n\n<h3>Subtask #1 : (10 points)</h3>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>N</b> ,<b>a<sub>i</sub> , b<sub>i</sub></b>  , <b>c</b> \u2264 <b>20</b></li>\n\n\n<h3>Subtask #2 : (90 points)</h3>\n<li><b>No additional constraints</b></li>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n<p>1<br>2 5<br>1 5<br>2 4<br>\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n1</p>\n</pre>\n\n<p> </p>\n<h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p>In the example there is only one suitable value x = 5. \nThen the chef takes 1 gift pack with 5 presents to the first city. \nHere he spends 2 days: he hangs around on the first day, and he gives away five presents on the second day. \nHe takes 2 suitcases with 10 presents to the second city.Here he spends 3 days \u2014 he gives away 4 presents on the second and the third days and throws the remaining 2 presents . In total, the chef spends 5 days traveling.<br>\n<br>\nFor x = 4 or less the chef won't have enough presents for the second day in the first city, so the journey will end too soon. For x = 6 and more the chef will spend at least one more day in the second city, and the journey will take too long.\n</p>\n\n",
