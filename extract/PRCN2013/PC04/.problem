The first line contains the coordinates of point A, second of point B, third of point C and fourth of point D.\n</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>For each test case, the output shall be a single word answer (in capital letters) stating whether the coordinates of each test case forms a \u201cRECTANGLE\u201d, \u201cSQUARE\u201d, \u201cRHOMBUS\u201d, \u201cQUADRILATERAL\u201d, \u201cPARALLELOGRAM\u201d or \u201cNONE\u201d (without quotes; quotes only for clarity) . </p>\n<p><b>Note:</b><br />\n<br />We know that a square is also a rectangle which is also a parallelogram which in turn is also a quadrilateral, however if the input satisfies all the properties of a specific type of a quadrilateral, the answer shall be that specific type of a quadrilateral ONLY and not any other type or simply \u2018QUADRILATERAL\u2019.\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>T</b> \u2264 <b> 100 </b></li>\n<li><b>-10000</b> \u2264 X,Y \u2264 <b>10000</b>, where (X,Y) denote the coordinates of point A, B, C or D.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n2\n0 0\n1 0\n1 1\n0 1\n1 1\n7 5\n1 9\n-5 5\n\n<b>Output:</b>\nSQUARE\nRHOMBUS\n</pre>",
