His mathematics teacher K.R. Atal Sir has given him a unique problem to solve and for the first time Pratik needs help. The problem goes as follows. <br /><br />\nYou are given a 2-D array of size N x M consisting of integers to which you can apply the following two operations with an associated cost :- </p>\n<p>1. Choose an element from the array and increment its value by unity.<br /><br />\n2. Choose an element from the array and decrement its value by unity.\n</p>\n<p>The 2-D array is magical only if it fulfills the following criterion:<br />\nThe matrix has a particular row or column consisting of only prime numbers.<br />\nPrint the minimum possible cost required to convert this 2-D array to a Magical Array using the given operations. All the elements in the array do not exceed 10^5.\n</p>\n<h3>Input : </h3>\n<p>First line contains two space separated integers N and M denoting the number of rows and columns of the matrix respectively.</p>\n<p>Second line contains two space separated integers A and B, the cost associated with the two operations respectively.</p>\n<p>Each of the following N lines contains M space separated integers, the initial rectangular array. </p>\n<h3>Output :</h3>\n<p>For every test case, print a single integer - the minimum cost to convert the rectangular array to a magical array.</p>\n<h3>Constraints :</h3>\n<p>1 \u2264 N,M \u2264 500<br /><br />\n1 \u2264 A,B \u2264 10^7</p>\n<h3>Example :</h3>\n<h4>Input:</h4>\n<p>3 3</p>\n<p>5 7</p>\n<p>1 2 8</p>\n<p>5 6 1</p>\n<p>4 4 1</p>\n<h4>Output: </h4>\n<p>10</p>\n<h3>Explanation:</h3>\n<p>For minimum possible cost one can increment the cell at (1,1) and (3,1) by unity. So the total associated cost with these two operations is 5+5 = 10.<br />\n<br /><br />\nAlternatively, one can also increment the cell at (2,2) and (2,3) by unity to get the minimum cost of 10.</p>\n<p></p></body></html></p>\n",
