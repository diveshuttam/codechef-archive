Any participant found to be indulging in any form of malpractice will be immediately disqualified.</p> <p>4. The total time is the sum of the time consumed for each problem solved. The time consumed for a solved problem is the time elapsed from the beginning of the contest to the submission of the first accepted run plus 20 penalty minutes for every previously rejected run for that problem(Wrong answer, Time limit exceeded, Runtime Error, Compilation Error ). There is no time consumed for a problem that is not solved.</p> <p>5. The decision of the organizers in declaring the results will be final. No queries in this regard will be entertained.</p>",
