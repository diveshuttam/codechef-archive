You have to help her decrypt the code.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe encrypted code is alphanumeric. Every alphabet can be replaced by a number from the set {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9} such that no two alphabets get the same numeric value.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe final decrypted code is the median of all the possible codes that can be formed using the above technique when the codes are sorted in lexicographical order (as in a dictionary).\n</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The First line contains the number of test cases, <b>T</b>.<br /></p>\n<p><b>T</b> test cases follow.<br /><br />\nEach test case contains a single line representing the encrypted code which is a combination of numbers from [0-9] (inclusive) and lowercase letters.\n</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>For each test case output the final decrypted code. In case there is more than one final decrypted code, output all of them on the same line separated by a space in lexicographic order.\n</p>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<p>Maximum length of input string : 10^5</p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n2\na58\na647b\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n458 558\n46479 56470\n</pre>",
