There are <b>n</b> villages in it. Some of the villages are occupied by dinosaurs while the remaining ones by villagers.<br />\n\tYou are given the information of DevuLand<br />\n\tby an array <b>D</b> of size <b>n</b>. If <b>D[i]</b> is non-negative, it means that there are <b>D[i]</b> villagers in that village.<br />\n\tOtherwise, it means that are -<b>D[i]</b><br />\n\tdinosaurs in that village.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tIt is also guaranteed that total number of villagers in DevuLand is equal to total number of dinosaurs.\n</p>\n<p>\nOnce dinosaurs got very hungry and started eating villagers. Frightened villagers gathered immediately and met their Sarpanch Deviji. Deviji, being a very daring and negotiable person, met to the head<br />\nof dinosaurs. Soon both parties called a truce. It was decided that the villagers will provide laddus to<br />\nthe dinosaurs. So everyday, each villager will take exactly one laddu to one of the dinosaurs in such a way that no dinosaur remains hungry (note that this is possible because number of villagers is the same as the number of dinosaurs).\n</p>\n<p>\nActually, carrying laddus is a quite a tough job. Villagers have to use a bullock cart for that. It takes one unit of grass a bullock to<br />\ncarry a cart with 1 laddu for <b>1</b> kilometre. Laddus used to be very heavy in DevuLand, so a bullock cart can not carry more than one laddu.</p>\n<p>It is also given distance between village indexed <b>i</b> and <b>j</b> is |<b>j</b> - <b>i</b>| (the absolute value) kilometres.\n</p>\n<p>\nNow villagers sat down and found a strategy to feed laddus to dinosaurs so that they need to buy the least amount of grass from the nearby market.<br />\nThey are not very good in<br />\ncalculations, please find out what is the minimum number of units of grass they need to buy.\n</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>\nFirst line of the input contains an integer <b>T</b> denoting number of test cases.\n</p>\n<p>\nFor each test case, there are two lines.\n</p>\n<p>\nFirst line contains a single integer denoting n: number of villages.\n</p>\n<p>\nSecond line contains n space separated integers denoting the array <b>D</b>.\n</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>\nFor each test case, print a single line containing the integer corresponding to answer of the problem.\n</p>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li> 1 \u2264 T \u2264 10^5 </li>\n<li> 1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5 </li>\n<li> -10^4 \u2264 D[i] \u2264 10^4 </li>\n<li> Sum of n over all the test cases will be \u2264 10^6 </li>\n<li> It is guaranteed that sum of D[i] is zero for a single test case which ensures that there are equal number of villagers and dinosaurs. </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n3\n2\n5 -5\n2\n-5 5\n3\n1 2 -3\n<b>Output:</b>\n5\n5\n4\n</pre><h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p><b>Example case 1.</b> Each villager in village 1, need to walk 1 km to reach to the dinosaur in 2nd village.</p>\n<p><b>Example case 2.</b> Each villager in village 2, need to walk 1 km to reach to the dinosaur 1st village.</p>\n<p><b>Example case 3.</b> Each villager in village 1, need to walk 2 km to reach to the dinosaur in 3rd village whereas Each villager in village 2,<br />\nneed to walk 1 km to reach to the dinosaur in 3rd village.</p>\n",
