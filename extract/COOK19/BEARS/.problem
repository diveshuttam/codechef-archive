This problem is right about this -- unfortunately, not about bears and bees (but if you want, you may think of vertices as of bears and of edges as of bees (or even vice versa)).\n\n</p><p>Suppose you're given an undirected graph <b>G<sub>0</sub></b> with <b>N</b> vertices and <b>M</b> edges. Let's perform a <i>simple transformation</i> on graph <b>G<sub>0</sub></b> to obtain graph <b>G<sub>1</sub></b> with <b>M</b> vertices so that each vertex of <b>G<sub>1</sub></b> corresponds to a unique edge of <b>G<sub>0</sub></b> and a pair of vertices in <b>G<sub>1</sub></b> is connected by a single edge if and only if the corresponding edges of <b>G<sub>0</sub></b> share a common vertex. Similarly, let's perform a simple transformation on graph <b>G<sub>1</sub></b> to obtain graph <b>G<sub>2</sub></b>, and let's perform a simple transformation on graph <b>G<sub>2</sub></b> to obtain graph <b>G<sub>3</sub></b>.\n\n</p><p>All you have to do is to output the number of vertices and edges in <b>G<sub>3</sub></b>.\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n</p><p>The first line of the input file contains one integer <b>T</b> -- the number of test cases (no more than 10). Each test case is described by a line containing two integers <b>N</b> and <b>M</b> (1 \u2264 <b>N</b>, <b>M</b> \u2264 1000) followed by <b>M</b> lines, each containing two integers between 1 and <b>N</b>, inclusive, separated by a single space and describing an edge of graph <b>G<sub>0</sub></b>. It's guaranteed that each edge connects two distinct vertices and each pair of vertices is directly connected by at most one edge.\n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n</p><p>For each test case output just one line containing two integers -- the number of vertices and edges in <b>G<sub>3</sub></b>.\n\n<h3>Example</h3>\n\n<pre>\n<b>Input:</b>\n2\n3 3\n1 2\n1 3\n2 3\n4 4\n1 2\n1 3\n2 3\n3 4\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n3 3\n8 18\n\n<b>Explanation:</b>\n</pre>\n</p><p>In the first test case the given graph is a \"triangle\". It's easy to see that a simple transformation on a triangle results in the same triangle (as it contains three pairwise connected vertices and three pairwise \"connected\" edges).</p>",
