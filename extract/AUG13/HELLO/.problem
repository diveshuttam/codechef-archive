As a result he exhausts his talk-value (in Rokdas) very quickly. One day at a mobile recharge shop, he noticed that his service provider gives add-on plans which can lower his calling rates (Rokdas/minute). One of the plans said \"Recharge for 28 Rokdas and enjoy call rates of 0.50 Rokdas/min for one month\". Chef was very pleased. His normal calling rate is 1 Rokda/min. And he talked for 200 minutes in last month, which costed him 200 Rokdas. If he had this plan activated, it would have costed him: 28 + 0.5*200 = 128 Rokdas only! Chef could have saved 72 Rokdas. But if he pays for this add-on and talks for very little in the coming month, he may end up saving nothing or even wasting money. Now, Chef is a simple guy and he doesn't worry much about future. He decides to choose the plan based upon his last month\u2019s usage.</p>\n<p>There are numerous plans. Some for 1 month, some for 15 months. Some reduce call rate to 0.75 Rokdas/min, some reduce it to 0.60 Rokdas/min. And of course each of them differ in their activation costs. <b>Note</b> - If a plan is valid for <b>M</b> months, then we must pay for (re)activation after every <b>M</b> months (once in M months). Naturally, Chef is confused, and you (as always) are given the task to help him choose the best plan.</p>\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>First line contains <b>T</b>- the number of test cases. In each test case, first line contains <b>D</b>- the default rate (Rokdas/minute, real number), <b>U</b>- the number of minutes Chef talked in last month and <b>N</b>- the number of add-on plans available. Then <b>N</b> lines follow, each containing <b>M</b>- the number of months the plan is valid for, <b>R</b>- the calling rate for the plan (Rokdas/minute, real number) and <b>C</b>- the cost of the plan.</p>\n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>For each test case, output one integer- the number of the best plan (from 1 to N). Output '0' if no plan is advantageous for Chef. No two plans are equally advantageous.</p>\n\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<p>1 \u2264 <b>T</b> \u2264 100<br/>0.5 \u2264 <b>D</b> \u2264 10.0 (exactly 2 digits after the decimal point)<br/>1 \u2264 <b>U</b> \u2264 10000<br/>1 \u2264 <b>N</b> \u2264 100<br/>1 \u2264 <b>M</b> \u2264 36<br/>0.05 \u2264 <b>R</b> &lt; <b>D</b> (exactly 2 digits after the decimal point)<br/>1 \u2264 <b>C</b> \u2264 1000</p>\n\n<h3>Example</h3>\n\n<pre>\n<b>Input:</b>\n4\n1.00 200 1\n1 0.50 28\n1.00 200 2\n1 0.75 40\n3 0.60 100\n1.00 50 2\n1 0.75 40\n3 0.60 100\n1.00 100 2\n3 0.50 10\n2 0.10 20\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n1\n2\n0\n2\n</pre>\n\n<h3>Explanation</h3>\n\n<p><b>Test Case 1:</b> This test case is same as the example in the problem statement.<br/><b>Test Case 2:</b> This is for you to work out!<br/><b>Test Case 3:</b> Chef's monthly usage is only 50 Rokdas and none of the 2 plans are advantageous, hence the answer is zero '0'.<br/><b>Test Case 4:</b> Again solve it yourself, but NOTE - if Chef had chosen plan 1, he would have to pay 10 Rokdas (Activation cost), after every 3 months and NOT every month. Similarly had he chosen plan 2, he would have to pay 20 Rokdas (Activation cost), after every 2 months.</p>",
