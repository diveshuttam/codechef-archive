    "body": "<p>As we all know ISM is converted into IIT.  So to celebrate this ecstasy seniors decided to organize a dance concert in which couples will dance together. There are <B>N</B> boys and <B>N</B> girls numbered from 1 to N. Seniors ask them to form groups. Now some among them are failed to form groups due to some reasons but they have keen desire to participate. So seniors decided a strategy that only people of different groups can form a couple.\n</p>\n\n<p>The only information you have is some pairs of integer designating peoples in form of <b> (a,b) </b> followed by an pair of character (<b>' G '</b> OR <b> 'B' </b> indicating given pair consist of which combination of peoples). \nNote that people of this particular pair belongs to the same group.  For  example if Boy 1 and Girl 1 as a pair is given and Boy1 and Girl 2 as a another pair is given then this simply means Boy 1 , Girl 1 and Girl 2 constitute the same group.\n</p>\nNote- No two boys are considered as a couple nor two girls are considered as  \ncouple. Assume that you are provided with enough pairs to identify groups.\n<br>\nAs Prince has to go out of station for urgent work and before leaving have to  \nmake proper arrangement so he is thinking how many combination of couples  \nwould be possible. Can you help him?\n</p>\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The first line contains two integers<b> N </b> and <b> M </b>, separated by a single space. </li>\n<li>Each <b>M</b> lines contains 2 integers and 2 characters each separated by a single space <b> a,b,C1,C2.</b> </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>An integer that denotes total number of permissible ways to choose a couple.\n.</p>\n\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>N</b> \u2264 <b>100000</b></li>\n<li><b>0</b> \u2264 <b>M</b> \u2264 <b>200000</b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>a, b</b> \u2264 <b>N</b></li>\n<li><b>C1</b> and <b>C2</b> either <b>'G'</b> or <b>'B'</b> </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n<b>2 2\n1 1 B G\n2 2 G B\n</b>\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n<b>2</b>\n</pre>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n<b>5 5\n1 2 B G\n1 3 B G\n1 4 G B\n1 4 G G\n1 5 G G\n</b>\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n<b>20</b>\n\n<h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p><b>Example case 1.</b> Since Boy 1 and Girl 1 constitute one group. Similarly Boy 2 and Girl 2 constitute other group. <br>So two combination of couples are possible only:<br>\nBoy 1 and Girl 2.<br>\nBoy 2 and Girl 1.<br>\nSo our answer will be <b>2</b> in this case.</p>",
