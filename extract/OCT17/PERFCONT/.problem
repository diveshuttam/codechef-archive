Predicting difficulty levels of the problems can be a daunting task. Chef wants his contests to be balanced in terms of difficulty levels of the problems.</p>\n\n<p>Assume a contest had total <b>P</b> participants. A problem that was solved by at least half of the participants (i.e. <b>P / 2</b> (integer division)) is said to be cakewalk difficulty. A problem solved by at max <b>P / 10</b> (integer division) participants is categorized to be a hard difficulty.</p>\n\n<p>Chef wants the contest to be balanced. According to him, a balanced contest must have exactly 1 cakewalk and exactly 2 hard problems. You are given the description of <b>N</b> problems and the number of participants solving those problems. Can you tell whether the contest was balanced or not?</p>\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The first line of the input contains an integer <b>T</b> denoting the number of test cases.</p>\n<p>The first line of each test case contains two space separated integers, <b>N, P</b> denoting the number of problems, number of participants respectively.</p>\n<p>The second line contains <b>N</b> space separated integers, <b>i</b>-th of which denotes number of participants solving the <b>i</b>-th problem.</p>\n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>For each test case, output \"yes\" or \"no\" (without quotes) denoting whether the contest is balanced or not.</p>\n\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>1 \u2264 <b>T, N</b> \u2264 500 </li>\n<li>1 \u2264 <b>P</b> \u2264 10<sup>8</sup> </li>\n<li>1 \u2264 Number of participants solving a problem \u2264 <b>P</b></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Subtasks</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Subtask #1</b> (40 points): <b>P</b> is a multiple of 10</li>\n<li><b>Subtask #2</b> (60 points): Original constraints</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre>\n<b>Input</b>\n6\n3 100\n10 1 100\n3 100\n11 1 100\n3 100\n10 1 10\n3 100\n10 1 50\n4 100\n50 50 50 50\n4 100\n1 1 1 1\n\n<b>Output</b>\nyes\nno\nno\nyes\nno\nno\n</pre>\n\n<h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p><b>Example case 1.</b>: The problems are of hard, hard and cakewalk difficulty. There is 1 cakewalk and 2 hard problems, so the contest is balanced.</p>\n<p><b>Example case 2.</b>: The second problem is hard and the third is cakewalk. There is 1 cakewalk and 1 hard problem, so the contest is not balanced.</p>\n<p><b>Example case 3.</b>: All the three problems are hard. So the contest is not balanced.</p>\n<p><b>Example case 4.</b>: The problems are of hard, hard, cakewalk difficulty. The contest is balanced.</p>\n<p><b>Example case 5.</b>: All the problems are cakewalk. The contest is not balanced.</p>\n<p><b>Example case 6.</b>: All the problems are hard. The contest is not balanced.</p>",
