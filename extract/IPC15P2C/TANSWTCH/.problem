A switch is a device, which can be either 'On' or 'Off' and can be toggled as we require. A \"Good Switch Sequence\"/GSS is one where <b>all the \"Off\" switches appear before the \"On\" switches in the sequence, <i>if they are present</i></b></p>\n<p>Now she got a switch sequence from her friend and decided to convert it to a GSS. At a particular instant she can <b>toggle</b> any <b>one</b> switch in the sequence from On to Off or vice versa. You need to tell her the <b>minimum number of toggles</b> she needs to do to achieve the goal of GSS.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The first line contains <b>T</b>, the number of Test Cases. T lines follow.</p>\n<p><br />Each Line of test case consists of a string <b>S -consisting of letters 'O' and 'N' only</b> , representing the given Switch Sequence. Character 'O' at an index i represents that the i'th switch is <b>OFF</b>. Character 'N' at an index i represents that the i'th switch is <b>ON</b> .</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>For each test case, output a single line containing the answer.</p>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>T</b> \u2264 <b>200</b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>|S|</b> \u2264 <b>100</b></li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n3\nONONO\nOOONNNNN\nNNNNOOO\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n2\n0\n3\n</pre><p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p><b>Example case 1.</b>There are many ways to get a GSS in two toggles. For example: Toggle the second and the fourth 'N's to get a GSS.<br />\n<br /><br />\n<b>Example case 2.</b>There is no need to toggle any switch as the given sequence is already a GSS.\n</p>\n",
