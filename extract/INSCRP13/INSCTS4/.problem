No wonder all other numbers want to get as close to 42 as possible. We'll call this the \"coolness\" factor of the number. Given multiple sequences of numbers, a number appearing in the same sequence of 42 has a \"coolness\" factor of 1 and those not appearing in the sequence with 42 but with another number of \"coolness \" factor 1 has a \"coolness\" factor 2 and so on.<br />\nThe number 42 has a \"coolness\" factor 0(infinitely cool).</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The first line of each test case contains n, m and r, where n is the number of sequences,m is the number of integers in each sequence and r is the number of queries. This is followed by n lines containing m integers each each. The last line in each test case contains r integers for which the \"coolness\" factor must be calculated with regard to the the sequences.</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>Output should contain r lines,each corresponding to the minimum possible \"coolness\" factors of the numbers in the query. If the \"coolness\" factor cannot be determined, it should output -1 for that case.</p>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>1&lt;=n&lt;=100</li>\n<li>1&lt;=m&lt;=100</li>\n<li>1&lt;=r&lt;=10</li>\n<li>1&lt;= integers in sequence &lt;=2000</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input 1:</b>\n3 4 3\n11 17 42 3\n22 15 11 10\n6 7 8 9\n15 11 9\n\n<b>Output 1:</b>\n2\n1\n-1\n</pre><p><br /></p>\n<pre><b>Input 2:</b>\n3 4 2\n42 19 1 6\n11 13 15 17\n13 16 18 15\n11 19\n\n<b>Output 2:</b>\n-1\n1\n</pre><p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p><b>Example case 1.</b> For the first case, 11 is in the same sequence as 42 and hence has a \"coolness\" factor as 1. 15 is in the same sequence as 11, which has a \"coolness\" factor 1. Hence coolness factor of 15 is 2. The \"coolness\" factor of 9 cannot be determined because it does appear in a sequence containing 42, nor does it appear in a sequence, in which atleast one of the number's \"coolness\" factor can be determined.</p>\n",
