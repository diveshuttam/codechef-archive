They decided to give Peter and George flowers. The supplier distributes only one flower per day. Either Peter gets the flower or George. When all the flowers are distributed, Peter has X flowers and George has Y flowers, X being greater than Y.<br />\nGiven X and Y, find out how many number of ways are there to distribute the flowers such that on any given day,the number of flowers that Peter has is greater than the number of flowers George. Your answer should be modulo 1000000007.\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The first line contains T, the number of test cases. T test cases follow.<br />\nEach test case is a single line containing two space separated integers X and Y, the number of flowers given to Peter and George respectively.\n</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>For each test case, there is a one line output. The number of ways of distributing X flowers to Peter and Y flowers to George,such that Peter always has a greater number of flowers than George on any day, modulo 10^9+7.\n</p>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<p>Should contain all the constraints on the input data that you may have. Format it like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>1 &lt;= T &lt;= 1000</li>\n<li>1 &lt;= Y &lt;= X &lt;= 100000</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n2\n3 2\n7 4\n\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n2\n90\n</pre><p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p><b>Example case 1.</b><br />(X,Y) = <br />(0,0) -> (1,0) -> (2,0) -> (2,1) -> (3,1) -> (3,2)<br />(0,0) -> (1,0) -> (2,0) -> (3,0) -> (3,1) -> (3,2)<br /></p>\n<p>These are the only 2 ways of distributing the flowers such that Peter has more flowers than George.\n</p>\n",
