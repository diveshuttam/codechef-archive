Since Chef Polo is wise, he selects the pancakes in such a way that no pancake falls on the floor.<br/><br />\nHis assistants have baked all the pancakes for him already,labelled them with their radius and have arranged them in a row.<br/><br />\nHe starts his selection of pancakes in same order as they are placed in the row.He has only one chance to select each pancake.<br/><br />\nIf he selects a pancake, he places it on the top of his tower else he moves on to the next one.<br/><br />\nYou are required to find the <b>maximum height</b> of the tower which he can build.<br />\n\u00a0</br/></br/></br/></br/></p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The first line contains the number of test cases <b>T</b>.<br />\nFirst line of each test case contains <b>n</b> (number of pancakes in the row)<br />\nNext line contains array <b>R</b> of <b>n</b> integers denoting the radii of pancakes.<br />\n.</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>For each test case, output a single line containing the maximum height of the tower he can build.</p>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>T</b> \u2264 <b>10</b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>n</b> \u2264 <b>10^5</b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>R[1...n]</b> \u2264 <b>10^9</b></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Sample Input:</h3>\n<p>2<br /><br />\n5<br /><br />\n8 7 2 3 4<br /><br />\n8<br /><br />\n2 9 4 6 5 2 2 1<br /></p>\n<h3>Sample Output:</h3>\n<p>3<br /><br />\n5</p>\n",
