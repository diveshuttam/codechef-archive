In this problem you will be given three recycling garbage bins, each containing a specified number of brown, green and clear bottles. In order to be recycled, the bottles will need to be moved so that each bin contains bottles of only one color.<br />\nThe problem is to separate different bottles in minimum number of moves or minimize the number of movements between boxes.<br />\nFor the purposes of this problem, each garbage bin has infinite capacity and the only constraint is moving the bottles so that each bin contains bottles of a single color. The total number of bottles will never exceed 2^31.</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.<br />\nFollowed of a series of lines with each line containing 9 integers. The first three integers on a line represent the number of brown, green, and clear bottles (respectively) in garbage bin number 1, the second three represent the number of brown, green and clear bottles (respectively) in garbage bin number 2, and the last three integers represent the number of brown, green, and clear bottles (respectively) in garbage  bin number 3. For example, the line 10 15 25 30 13 8 19 8 31<br />\nindicates that there are 25 clear bottles in garbage bin 1, 13 green bottles in garbage bin 2, and 19 brown bottles in garbage bin 3.\n</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>\nFor each line of input there will be one line of output indicating what color bottles go in what garbage bin to minimize the number of bottle movements. You should also print the minimum number of bottle movements.<br />\nThe output should consist of a string of the three upper case characters 'G', 'B', 'C' (representing the colors green, brown, and clear) representing the color associated with each garbage bin.<br />\nThe first character of the string represents the color associated with the first garbage bin, the second character of the string represents the color associated with the second garbage bin, and the third character represents the color associated with the third garbage bin.<br />\nThe integer indicating the minimum number of bottle movements should follow the string.<br />\nIf more than one order of brown, green, and clear garbage bins yields the minimum number of movements then the alphabetically first string representing a minimal configuration should be printed.\n</p>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<p>\nTest cases(1 = T =20)<br/><br />\nTotal number of bottles = 2^31\n</br/></p>\n<h3>Sample Input</h3>\n<pre>\n2\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 <br/>\n5 10 5 20 10 5 10 20 10\n</br/></pre><h3>Sample Output\n<pre>\nBCG 30<br/>\nCBG 50\n</br/></pre><p>\n<br />\n</p>\n</h3>",
