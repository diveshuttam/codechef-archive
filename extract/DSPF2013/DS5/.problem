The country was divided into N regions (LA  was region number 1, and NYC number 13). A number ,k, would be picked `at random', and the Electricity would first be turned off in region 1 (clearly the fair at starting point) and then in every k'th region after that, wrapping around to 1 after N, and ignoring regions already turned off.<br />\nThe problem is that it is perfectly fair to turn off  electricity of NYC in  last (because, the Electricity headquarters are situated there), so for a given N, the `random' number k needs to be carefully chosen so that region 13 is the last region selected.<br />\nWrite a code that will take a input number of regions and then find out the smallest number k that will ensure that NYC (region 13) can have electricity  while the rest of the country is in electricity cutoff.\n </p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>In each line input consists of a integer N (greater than or equal to 13) and input will be terminated by a line containing 0.\n</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>\nOutput may have a single line or a series of lines, one for each line of the input. Each line will consist of the number k according to the above scheme.</p>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<p>\nNumber of regions (13&lt;=N&lt;=100)\n</p>\n<h3>Sample Input</h3>\n<pre>\n17<br/>\n18<br/>\n0</br/></br/></pre><h3>Sample Output\n<pre>7<br/>\n17\n</br/></pre><p><br />\n</p>\n</h3>",
