Chefcity can be represented as a straight line with Chef's house at point 0 on this line. There is an infinite number of subway stations in Chefcity, numbered by positive integers. The first station is located at point 1 and for each <b>i</b> \u2265 1, the distance between stations <b>i</b> and <b>i+1</b> is equal to <b>i+1</b>. (Station <b>i+1</b> is always located at a higher coordinate than station <b>i</b>, i.e., the subway stations are located at points 1, 3, 6, 10, 15 etc.)</p>\n\n<p>Subway trains in Chefcity allow Chef to move between any pair of adjacent stations in one minute, regardless of the distance between them. Chef can also move by walking; his walking speed is one unit of distance in one minute. Chef can enter or exit the subway at any station.</p>\n\n<p>Chef has decided to go to the cinema. The only cinema in Chefcity is located at point <b>X</b>. (Note that the cinema can be placed at the same point as a subway station.) Help Chef determine the minimum possible time required to get to the cinema from his house.</p>\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The first line of the input contains a single integer <b>T</b> denoting the number of test cases. The description of <b>T</b> test cases follows.</li>\n<li>The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer <b>X</b>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>For each test case, print a single line containing one integer - the minimum possible travel time.</p>\n\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>1 \u2264 <b>T</b> \u2264 200</li>\n<li>1 \u2264 <b>X</b> \u2264 10<sup>9</sup></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n\n4\n1\n2\n3\n9\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n\n1\n2\n2\n5\n</pre>\n\n<h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p><b>Example case 4:</b> Chef will walk from <b>x</b> = 0 to <b>x</b> = 1 in one minute, then he will enter the subway and move from station 1 (at <b>x</b> = 1) to station 2 (at <b>x</b> = 3) in one minute, then from station 2 to station 3 (at <b>x</b> = 6) in one minute, from station 3 to station 4 (at <b>x</b> = 10) in one minute, and finally, he will walk from <b>x</b> = 10 to <b>x</b> = 9 in one minute, which makes the total travel time 5 minutes.</p>\n",
