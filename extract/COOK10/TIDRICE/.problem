    "body": "<span class=\"solution-visible-txt\">All submissions for this problem are available.</span><p align=\"justify\">\nDid you know that there are over 40,000 varieties of Rice in the world ? There are so many dishes that can be prepared with Rice too. A famous chef from Mumbai, Tid Gusto prepared a new dish and named it 'Tid Rice'. He posted the recipe in his newly designed blog for community voting, where a user can plus (+) or minus (-) the recipe. The final score is just the sum of all votes, where (+) and (-) are treated as +1 and -1 respectively. But, being just a chef ( and not a codechef ) he forgot to take care of multiple votes by the same user.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\nA user might have voted multiple times and Tid is worried that the final score shown is not the correct one. Luckily, he found the user logs, which had all the <b>N</b> votes in the order they arrived.  Remember that, if a user votes more than once, the user's previous vote is first nullified before the latest vote is counted ( see explanation for more clarity ). Given these records in order ( and being a codechef yourself :) ), calculate the correct final score.\n</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p align=\"justify\">First line contains T ( number of testcases, around 20 ). T cases follow. Each test case starts with N ( total number of votes, 1 &lt;= N &lt;= 100 ). Each of the next N lines is of the form \"userid vote\" ( quotes for clarity only ), where userid is a non-empty string of lower-case alphabets ( 'a' - 'z' ) not more than 20 in length and vote is either a + or - . See the sample cases below, for more clarity.\n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n</p><p align=\"justify\">For each test case, output the correct final score in a new line\n\n<h3>Example</h3>\n\n<pre>\n<b>Input:</b>\n3\n4\ntilak +\ntilak +\ntilak -\ntilak +\n3\nratna +\nshashi -\nratna -\n3\nbhavani -\nbhavani +\nbhavani -\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n1\n-2\n-1\n</pre><br />\n<b>Explanation</b><br /><br />\n<pre>Case 1 : Initially score = 0. Updation of scores in the order of user tilak's votes is as follows,<br />\n( + ): +1 is added to the final score. This is the 1st vote by this user, so no previous vote to nullify. score = 1\n( + ):  0 should be added ( -1 to nullify previous (+) vote, +1 to count the current (+) vote ). score = 1\n( - ) : -2 should be added ( -1 to nullify previous (+) vote, -1 to count the current (-) vote ). score = -1\n( + ): +2 should be added ( +1 to nullify previous (-) vote, +1 to count the current (+) vote ). score = 1<br />\n</pre></p>",
