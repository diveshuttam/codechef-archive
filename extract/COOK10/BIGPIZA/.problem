    "body": "<span class=\"solution-visible-txt\">All submissions for this problem are available.</span><p align=\"justify\">Did you know that the people of America eat around 100 acres of pizza per day ? Having read this fact on internet, two chefs from the Elephant city, Arjuna and Bhima are set to make pizza popular in India. They organized a social awareness camp, where <b>N</b> people ( other than these two ) sit around a large pizza. To make it more interesting, they make some pairs among these N people and the two persons in a pair, feed each other.<br />\n</p><p align=\"justify\">Each person should be a part of at most one pair and most importantly, to make feeding easy, any two pairs should not cross each other ( see figure for more clarity ). Arjuna and Bhima decided to play a game on making the pairs. In his turn, a player makes a pair ( selects two persons, as long as its valid ) and this pair start feeding each other. Arjuna and Bhima take turns alternately, by making a pair in each turn, and they  play optimally ( see Notes for more clarity ). The one who can not make a pair in his turn, loses. Given N, find who wins the game, if Arjuna starts first. <br />\n<img src=\"http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5142/5702697471_007b748139.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"213\" />\n\n<h3>Notes</h3><ul><li>'Optimally' means, if there is a possible move a person can take in his turn that can make him win finally, he will always take that. You can assume both are very intelligent. </li></ul>\n<br />\n<h3>Input</h3>\n</p><p>First line contains an integer T ( number of test cases, around 1000 ). Each of the next T lines contains an integer N ( 2 &lt;= N &lt;= 10000 )\n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n</p><p>For each test case, output the name of the winner ( either \"Arjuna\" or \"Bhima\" ( without quotes ) ) in a new line.\n\n<h3>Example</h3>\n\n<pre>\n<b>Input:</b>\n4\n2\n4\n5\n6\n\n<b>Output:</b>\nArjuna\nArjuna\nBhima\nArjuna\n</pre>\n<br />\n<b>Explanation:</b><br /><br />\nLet the people around the table are numbered 1, 2, ... , N in clock-wise order as shown in the image <br /><br />\nCase 1 : N = 2. Only two persons and Arjuna makes the only possible pair (1,2)<br /><br />\nCase 2 : N = 4. Arjuna can make the pair (1,3). Bhima can not make any more pairs ( without crossing the pair (1,3) )<br /><br />\nCase 3 : N = 5. No matter which pair Arjuna makes first, Bhima can always make one more pair, and Arjuna can not make any further<br /><br /></p>",
