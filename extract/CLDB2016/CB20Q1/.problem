Their positions are specified three rectangular coordinates<b>(x,y,z)</b>. Their speeds are<br />\nidentified by <b>v</b>. There are <b>M</b> bigger planes and <b>P</b> smaller planes.<br />\nThere are two runways :- 1st for the big planes and the other for small planes. From the given grid of planes, you have to identify<br />\nwhether all the planes can land safely or not and if not then what should be done to the planes that are probable for collision in terms of speed.<br />\nOne of the planes that are colliding should have its speed changed so that it reaches that same point exactly 1 second later. For deciding which plane should<br />\nhave its speed changed, the plane whose coordinates are entered later will be chosen. Any newly entered coordinates should not match with any of the previously<br />\nentered coordinates. Until you enter the new unique coordinates,it will prompt for the new coordinates including velocity(for planes).<br />\n\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>First line will contain 3 space separated integers for the 3 coordinates of the airport for big planes.<br />\nsecond line will contain 3 space separated integers for the 3 coordinates of the airport for small planes.<br />\nThe next line will contain 2 space separated integers,<b>A</b> and <b>B</b>. A is the number of big planes.B is the number of small planes.<br />\nThen the following A lines will contain 4 space separated integers ,i.e., x y z v, for the big planes.<br />\nAfter the A lines, there will be B lines, each line containing 4 space separated integers,i.e., x y z v, for the small planes..</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>if there is a situation of <b>N</b> crashes, then there should be <b>N</b> output cases.<br />\nFirst line of each case should have the output \"plane number crash plane number\".<br />\nThen the line following should be the new velocity of the latter plane with value upto 2 decimal places.<br />\nThen after all the N cases, false should be printed.<br />\nIf, no crash is there, then output should be true.</p>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b>2</b> \u2264 <b>M</b> \u2264 <b>5</b></li>\n<li><b>2</b> \u2264 <b>P</b> \u2264 <b>5</b></li>\n<li><b>4</b> \u2264 <b>N</b> \u2264 <b>10</b></li>\n<li><b>V</b> != <b>0</b></li>\n<li><b>0</b> \u2264 <b>Z</b></li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n0 0 0\n1 1 1\n2 2\n40 30 50 100\n-40 30 50 100\n25 36 45 200\n65 48 98 150\n\n<b>Output:</b>\nplane 1 crash plane 2\nnew velocity 41.42\nfalse\n</pre><p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p><b>Plane 1 and Plane 2 will crash at some point.So 1st line shows \"plane 1 crash plane 2\".<br />Then the next line shows the new velocity of plane 2.<br />The last line says false because the case is unstable.</b> ...</p>\n",
