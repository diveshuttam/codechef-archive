The event will be witnessing participation from all over the country and students from various colleges will register for the same. To manage these registrations a team of students have been formed and has been instructed by their faculty to ensure smooth running of the event. These student team comprises of 10 members out of which 2 have been specifically assigned with the task of organising the registrations in orderly fashion. The 2 students decided to form a programme to organise the registration but being poor programmers are not able to come up with an apt programme. Thus to accomplish this task you guys have to help them with seeking out the proper code. Below we have listed the details about the pattern they came up with and registration details.\n</p>\n<p>The students have planned to the registration of the students who wants to register for the events organized in TRITI using linked list. The details that organizers want from the participants of their event are their college name(<b>C</b>), event name (<b>E</b>), student name(<b>S</b>). Each participant must give all the details that are asked by the event organizer, as it is important for the organizer to know all the required details of all the participants. The student gave all the details to the organizers but they did not accept it and they asked the students who were taking the registration must submit all the details of participant who have registered in sorted order. As the students started sorting the registration they find it difficult to sort and print the result in simple order, so they decided to use the recursion on the print function as they find it easy to use it and important. And they get the final list in order that the organizers want. The final list was provided to the organizers and they find the new final list as they wanted.\n</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>\n1st line number of Inputs <b>N</b><br /><br />\nThen followed by:<br /><br />\nCollage Name<br /><br />\nEvent Name<br /><br />\nStudent name<br />\n.</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>\nCollage  Name<br /><br />\nEvent Name<br /><br />\nName of all Participants in the Event\n</p>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<p>Should contain all the constraints on the input data that you may have.
