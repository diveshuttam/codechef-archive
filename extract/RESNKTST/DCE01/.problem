Quite beautifully, wih sparkling light, it seemed to be flying.<br />\nBut air does not have ice bergs. <br />\nA sudden crashing sound and a piece of ice floating by. But the depth is far greater than what it looks on the surface. <br />\nOur ship is hit and has taken serious damages. The iceberg has damaged one of the sectors in the lowermost level. ( Where were the Lookers looking from the Look Out?? !! )\n<br />\nThe captain has assigned you the job of finding the total time in sinking of the ship. <br />\nThe ship is considered sunk only when all the sectors at all levels are drowned completely in water. <br />\n\nA ship is represented in sectors as below: <br />\n<pre>\n+ + + + +     \n + + + +\n  + + +\n</pre><br />\nn is the number of sectors in the topmost level, k is the number of levels. <br />\n\nThe first(topmost) level contains n sectors, 2nd contains n-1 sectors, and the k-th(lowermost) sector contains n-k+1 sectors.<br />\nWater starts getting into a sector only when one(or both) of the following conditions are met: <br />\n* a neighbor of the sector is completely drowned. <br />\n* both the sectors under a sector are completely drowned. <br />\n<pre>\n   +  a  +\n     b  c  \n</pre>\n\nHere, \"a\" will drown when both \"b\" and \"c\" are completely drowned. OR either of the neighbors ( + ) are completely submerged into water.<br />\n\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The first line contains the number of test cases (about 10). t test cases follow. <br />\nFor each test case, the first line contains three integers n(<=1000), k(<n), m(the damaged sector of the lowermost level, 1-based). <br />\nThe next k lines contain the integers denoting the time taken for the sectors in k-th level to drown completely.<br />\n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>Display t lines each having the single integer, the total time after which, the ship will be completely submerged in water.\n\n<h3>Example</h3>\n\n<pre>\n<b>Input:</b>\n1\n7 2 3\n2 3 1 7 5 9 6\n4 6 5 4 7 2\n\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n33\n</pre>\n<br /><br />\n<b>Explanation:</b>\nThe sinking time of all the sectors for this example are:\n<pre>\n17  15  12 16 21  27  33\n  15  11   5   9  16  18\n</pre>\n<br />Hence the answer 33.",
