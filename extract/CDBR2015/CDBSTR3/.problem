Many people who are to raise funds for their cause will be coming to this event.<br />\nCarol has been having some financial issues with her NGO. Today she\u2019ll have to convince some of the donors to donate for her NGO.<br />\nAs she has good links with the organisers, she managed to gather a description of the fixed donors disposition on the room (which is represented as an N \u00d7 N square matrix), such that she knows in advance the amount each person will donate. She also knows<br />\nthat the room is divided into several parallel corridors, such that we will denote the j-th cell on corridor i, as [i][j].<br />\n Note that some donors can donate Carol, zero money or negative money(taking back what they consented to give already), as they may change their minds.<br />\nThere is just one donor at each cell of the matrix, except the cells [1][1] and [N][N]. To complete her fundraising, she must start on the top leftmost corner of the room (cell [1][1]), and finish on the bottom right corner (cell [N][N]), moving either to the cell directly in front of her on the same corridor (that is, moving from cell [r][c] to cell [r][c+1], where c+1 &lt;= N) or to the cell in the next corridor directly in front of where she is (that is, moving from cell [r][c] to cell [r+1][c], where r+1 &lt;= N). She will keep doing this until she reaches the end point of the room, i.e. last cell [N][N] on the last corridor. Carol will convince all visited cells with a donor.<br />\nCarol wants to maximize her average donation at end. More specifically, if she passes K donors, each being on cell [i1][j1],<br />\n cell [i2][j2], ..., cell [iK][jK] respectively, then she wants to maximize (S[i1][j1] + S[i2][j2] + ... + S[iK][jK]) / K, where S[i][j] denotes the amount that the donor will give her on the cell [i][j].<br />\nHelp her determine the best path she has to follow in order to maximize the average donations.\n</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\nThe first line of the input contains an integer <b>T</b> denoting the number of test cases.\n</li>\n<li>\nThe  first  line  contains  a  single  integer <b>N</b> denoting the number of size of matrix.</li>\n<li> Each  of  the  next  <b>N</b>  lines  contains  <b>N</b>  space-separated  integers.\n</li>\n<p><br/><br />\n<b>Note : </b><br />\nThe j-th integer S[i][j] in i-th line denotes the donation donated by the donor at cell [i][j].<br />\nNote that the cells [1][1] and [N][N] have no donors, so S[1][1] and S[N][N] will be 0.</br/></p>\n</ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>For each test case, if the maximum possible average funds  Carol can obtain is negative, output a single line containing \"No funds\" (quotes for clarity). Otherwise, output the maximum possible average funds. The answer will be considered correct if it has an absolute error no more than <b>10<sup>-6</sup></b>.</p>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>T</b> \u2264 <b> 50 </b></li>\n<li><b>2</b> \u2264 <b>N</b> \u2264 <b> 100 </b></li>\n<li><b>-1000</b> \u2264 <b>S[i][j]</b> \u2264 <b> 1000 </b></li>\n<li><b>S[1][1]</b> = <b>S[N][N]</b> = <b> 0 </b></li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n2\n2\n0 -4\n3 0\n2\n0 -4\n-3  0\n<p></p>\n<b>Output:</b>\n3.000000\nNo funds\n</pre><p>\u00a0</p>\n",
