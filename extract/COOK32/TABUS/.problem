The Chef is a perfect example for this fact. He always tries to reduce the longest period of time of waiting for a bus. Therefore, optimizing the traveling plan for him is far from an easy task.\n</p>\n<p>\nLet's consider the bus system with <b>N</b> bus stations (numbered from <b>1</b> to <b>N</b>) and <b>M</b> buses (numbered from <b>1</b> to <b>M</b>). Each bus is represented by 4 integer numbers <b>U, V, S, E</b> which means it will start at the bus station <b>U</b> at the time <b>S</b> and arrive at the bus station <b>V</b> at the time <b>E</b> with no intermediate bus stations. If passenger arrives at the bus station <b>U</b> at the time <b>X</b> \u2264 <b>S</b>, he has to wait for <b>S \u2212 X</b> units of time to catch this bus. Note, that if he arrives at the bus station <b>U</b> exactly at time <b>S</b> he can catch this bus with no waiting time.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe Chef starts at the time <b>0</b> in the bus station <b>1</b>, and he wants to arrive at the bus station <b>N</b> in a way that the longest period that he spends for waiting for a bus is as small as possible. Besides, he must be at the bus station <b>N</b> before or at the time <b>T</b> for a specially important meeting. Note, that he may wait for a meeting if he arrives at the bus station <b>N</b> early but that period is not our concern here, since he doesn't wait for any bus at that time.\n</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>\nThe first line of the input contains three space-separated integers <b>N</b>, <b>T</b> and <b>M</b>, denoting the number of bus stations, the deadline for coming to bus station <b>N</b> and the number of buses, respectively. Each of the following <b>M</b> lines contains four space-separated integers <b>U</b>, <b>V</b>, <b>S</b>, <b>E</b>, the parameters of the current bus as described in the problem statement.\n</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>\nIf Chef cannot arrive at the bus station <b>N</b> before or at the time <b>T</b>, output <b>-1</b>. Otherwise, output the maximum period of time he has to wait for a bus in the optimal traveling plan.\n</p>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>2</b> \u2264 <b>N</b> \u2264 <b>50000</b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>T</b> \u2264 <b>10<sup>9</sup></b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>M</b> \u2264 <b>100000</b> (<b>10<sup>5</sup></b>)</li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>U</b> \u2264 <b>N</b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>V</b> \u2264 <b>N</b></li>\n<li><b>U</b> \u2260 <b>V</b></li>\n<li><b>0</b> \u2264 <b>S</b> &lt; <b>E</b> \u2264 <b>10<sup>9</sup></b></li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre>\n<b>Input:</b>\n5 10 5\n1 2 1 2\n1 5 3 4\n2 4 4 5\n2 5 5 6\n4 5 6 7\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n2\n</pre><h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p>\nThere are three different traveling plans:\n<ul>\n<li><b>bus 1 \u2192 bus 3 \u2192 bus 5</b>. His waiting time for each bus is 1, 2, 1, respectively.</li>\n<li><b>bus 2</b>. His waiting time is 3.</li>\n<li><b>bus 1 \u2192 bus 4</b>. His waiting time for each bus is 1, 3, respectively.</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n<p>\nFor each traveling plan Chef arrives at the bus station <b>N = 5</b> before the time <b>T = 10</b>. But only the first traveling plan is optimal, since the longest period of time his has to wait is 2.\n</p>\n",
