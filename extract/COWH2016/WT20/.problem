Now, BCCI figures that time slots of some matches may clash. So, BCCI wants to cancel one of the requests and see if the remaining matches can be scheduled to be played in the same venue. You have to calculate the number of ways in which it can be done.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The first line contains integer n (1&lt;=n&lt;=500000), the number of  teams in pool B other than India. Then, n lines follow, each of which contains two integers, x and y (1&lt;=x&lt;=y&lt;=1000000)\u2013 starting and finishing time for each slot. It may be possible that no matches clash initially. </p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>Output integer k- the number of ways to remove one time slot such that remaining time of other matches don\u2019t intersect. In the second line, output k numbers, indices of matches, on cancellation of which rest of the matches can be scheduled.<br />\nMatches are numbered from 1 to n in the order thay appear in the input. Output the indices of matches in increasing order.\n</p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n3\n3 10\n20 30\n1 3\n\n4\n3 10\n20 30\n1 3\n1 39\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n3\n1 2 3\n\n1\n4\n\n</pre><p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p>In first test case, on cancelling each time slot rest of the two are organisable.<br />\nIn second test case, even on cancelling first three time slots one by one, matches will get clashed. For making the tournament organisable fourth slot has to be cancelled. So, BCCI is left with only one option, i.e., cancelling fourth slot.\n</p>\n",
