Let us remind you that a graph's spanning tree is defined as an acyclic connected subgraph of the given graph that includes all of the graph's vertexes. The weight of a tree is defined as the sum of weights of the edges that the given tree contains. The minimum spanning tree (MST) of a graph is defined as the graph's spanning tree having the minimum possible weight. For any connected graph obviously exists the minimum spanning tree, but in the general case, a graph's minimum spanning tree is not unique.<br />\nNow Dhoni asks Jadeja a difficult question and says he will not play until he answers it. Sir Jadeja knows you are good at graphs so he asks you to do the task for him.<br />\nThe question is as follows:- determine the following for each edge of the given graph: whether it is either included in any MST, or included at least in one MST, or not included in any MST.\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The first line contains two integers n and m (2\u2009\u2264\u2009n\u2009\u2264\u200910^5,  ) \u2014 the number of the graph's vertexes and edges, correspondingly. Then follow m lines, each of them contains three integers \u2014 the description of the graph's edges as \"ai bi wi\" (1\u2009\u2264\u2009ai,\u2009bi\u2009\u2264\u2009n,\u20091\u2009\u2264\u2009wi\u2009\u2264\u200910^6,\u2009ai\u2009\u2260\u2009bi), where ai and bi are the numbers of vertexes connected by the i-th edge, wi is the edge's weight. It is guaranteed that the graph is connected and doesn't contain loops or multiple edges.</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>Print m lines \u2014 the answers for all edges. If the i-th edge is included in any MST, print \"any\"; if the i-th edge is included at least in one MST, print \"at least one\"; if the i-th edge isn't included in any MST, print \"none\". Print the answers for the edges in the order in which the edges are specified in the input.</p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre>\nSample test cases\nInput\n\n4 5\n1 2 101\n1 3 100\n2 3 2\n2 4 2\n3 4 1\n\nOutput\n\nnone\nany\nat least one\nat least one\nany\n\nInput\n\n3 3\n1 2 1\n2 3 1\n1 3 2\n\nOutput\n\nany\nany\nnone\n\nInput\n\n3 3\n1 2 1\n2 3 1\n1 3 1\n\nOutput\n\nat least one\nat least one\nat least one\n\n</pre><p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p>In the second sample the MST is unique for the given graph: it contains two first edges.<br />\nIn the third sample any two edges form the MST for the given graph. That means that each edge is included at least in one MST.\n</p>\n",
