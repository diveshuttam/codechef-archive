As he is a very good student, he already learned 1, 2, 3 and 4. \n            But he did not realize yet that 4 is different from 1, so he thinks that 4 is \n            another way to write 1. Besides that, he is having fun with a little game he \n            created himself: he make numbers (with those four digits) and sum their values. \n            For instance:</span><span lang=\"RU\"> </span>\n        </p>\n        <p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n            <span lang=\"RU\">132 = 1 + 3 + 2 = 6</span><span lang=\"RU\"> </span>\n        </p>\n        <p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n            <span lang=\"RU\">112314 = 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 1 + 1 = 9</span><span lang=\"RU\"> </span>\n        </p>\n        <p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n            <span lang=\"RU\">(Remember that Ali thinks that 4 = 1)</span><span lang=\"RU\"> </span>\n        </p>\n        <p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n            <span lang=\"RU\">\u00a0</span><span lang=\"RU\"> </span>\n        </p>\n        <p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n            <span lang=\"RU\">After making a lot of numbers in this way, Ali now \n            wants to know how much numbers he can create such that their sum is a number n. \n            For instance, for n=2 he noticed that he can make 5 numbers: 11, 14, 41, 44 and \n            2 (he knows how to count them up, but he does not know how to write five). \n            However, he cannot figure it out for n greater that 2. So, he asked you to help \n            him.</span><span lang=\"RU\"> </span>\n        </p>\n        <p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n            <span lang=\"RU\">\u00a0</span><span lang=\"RU\"> </span>\n        </p>\n        <p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n            <b><span lang=\"RU\">Input:</span></b><span lang=\"RU\"> </span>\n        </p>\n        <p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n            <span lang=\"RU\">Input will consist on an arbitrary number of sets. \n            Each set will consist on an integer n such that 1 &lt;= n &lt;= 1000.
