Recently he has devlopped a small search engine which perform search for a string S in database. He has used following Algorithm for searching.<br>\n\tSuppose there are N strings in database. It starts comparing string with each string in the database from the beginning. Two strings are compared letter by letter from start until a mismatch found or end of one of the string reaches.When algorithm find the string S in database, it terminates. Every comparison is counted as a single step.<br>\n\tYour task is to write a program that calculates number of steps the algorithm uses to find each of the Q query strings.\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>\nInput will begin with an integer N, number of strings in data base. Each of the following N lines contain a single string from database. Strings are given in the order the algorithm compare them to a query string. All strings in database will be distinct.\nThe following line contains an integer Q, the number of queries. Each of the following Q lines contain a single query string. All strings in the input will be strings of less than 30 lowercase letters of the English alphabet.\n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>\nPrint one integer per line for each query string, the number of steps algorithm uses while searching for the string in the same order as given in the input.\n\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<p>\n        1 <= N <= 30,000<br>\n\t1 <= Q <= 30,000\n\n<h3>Example</h3>\n\n<pre>\n<b>Input:</b>\n5\navsvinaystp\nbvksgptk\nvkrjgr\nrobot\nhabbit\n3\nhabbit\nvkrjgr\nbvkija\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n11\n9\n8\n\n</pre>\n<h3>Explanation</h3>\nOutput for first query  is 11, which is result of 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 7, for corresponding strings in database.",
