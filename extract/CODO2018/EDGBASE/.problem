Instead he uses a separate base Xi for the i-th station. In order to represent numbers in a particular station, he uses Xi different symbols. Each of these symbols is a number p where $0 \\leq p \\le Xi$.\n\nFor portability of his experiments, he needs to convert the numbers back and forth from station to station. Given a number D in base Xi, your job is to find out the number of symbols (NOT necessarily distinct) needed to represent that number in base Xj.\n\nNote:\n\nONLY the number of symbols is wanted. That means you need to find out the length of representation of D in Xj.\n\nFor every base Xi, it is ensured that log(base 2) of Xi is always an integer.\n\n\n###Input:\n\n- The first line consists of two space-separated integers N and Q, the number of stations and the number of queries respectively.\n- The next line contains array X, where the value Xi is the base used for station i.\n- There are 2*Q more lines.\n\n###Output:\n- Print Q lines, where each line contains the answer to that query.\n\n###Constraints \n- $1 \\leq N,Q \\leq 10e4$\n- $2 \\leq Xi \\leq 5000$\n- $1 \\leq i,j \\leq N$\n- $1 \\leq |D|<=10e4$\n\n|D| represents the length of D in base i.\n\nEach symbol used to represent D in base i is a number p where $0 \\leq p \\le Xi$.\n\n###Sample Input:\n\t3 2   \n 2 8 4  \n 2 3   \n 0 7 2 1    \n 3 2  \n 3 0 2 1 2 0  \n\n###Sample Output:\n\t6\n4\n\t\n###EXPLANATION:\nFor the first query, D is in base 8.\n\n(0721)base8 = (013101)base4\ntherefore, length of 013101 = 6.\n\nFor the second query, D is in base 4.\n\n(302120)base4 = (6230)base8\ntherefore, length of 6230 = 4.\n",
