His <span class=\"GramE\">conversation with R2-D2 are</span>\nalways fun to observe un that R2-D2 speaks in Droid, C-3PO speak in English,\nand they understand each other perfectly! Anyway, humans and droids both enjoy\nplaying word games.<br /><br /> A palindrome is a word or sequence of one or more letters\nthat reads the same forwards and backwards. A near palindrome is a word or\nsequence that can be changed to or kept a palindrome by changing exactly one\nletter to a different letter. For example, BAT is a near palindrome, since\nchanging the T to a B would make the word a palindrome: BAB. PEEP is not a near\npalindrome: although PEEP is palindrome, changing any letter would remove its\npalindrome status.<br /><br />A double near palindrome is a word or sequence that consists\nof two near palindromes concatenated together. For example, BATMAN is a double\nnear palindrome, since BAT and MAN are both near palindromes. Given a list of\nwords, you are to determine which words are double near palindromes and which\nare not.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><b><span lang=\"EN-US\">Input</span></b></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">The input consists of one\nor more words. All words (except the last) will be inclusively between 1 and 25\nletters long and will consist of entirely of capital letters. The last word\nwill be *END* and is not be processed; it simply indicates the end of the\ninput. There may be any number of spaces and characters before, after, and\nbetween words.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><b><span lang=\"EN-US\">Output</span></b></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">The output cases are to\nappear in the same order in which they appear in the input. For each input\ncase, you are to print either w is a double near palindrome. <span class=\"GramE\">or</span>\nw is not a double near palindrome. whichever is appropriate, where w is the\ninput word. Exactly one should follow each output case (meaning there should be\nno blank lines in the output).</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\"> </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><b><u><span lang=\"EN-US\">Sample Input:</span></u></b></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">BATMAN<br /> CONSTANTINOPLE <br />*END*</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\"> </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><b><u><span lang=\"EN-US\">Sample Output:</span></u></b></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">BATMAN is a double near palindrome.<br /> CONSTANTINOPLE is not a double near palindrome.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\"> </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Time <span class=\"GramE\">limit<span> \n</span>:</span><span>   </span>1s</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Source limit:<span>       </span>50000B</span></p>",
