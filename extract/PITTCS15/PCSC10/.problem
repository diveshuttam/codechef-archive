Each of them know that it is vital to get a good spot in the beginning of the game, yet each of them differ on their opinions of what makes a spot good.  Each of them ranks the different resources in a different way.  For example, Phillip thinks that sheep are the key to victory while Alex is a brick man.  Help them figure out where they should put their starting settlement.  Create a program that takes in a settlers board, with each tile being represented by a letter ID, a letter denoting which resource, and a roll frequency, followed by a list of the players and their ranking of each resource, and output the top spot each player should pick. .</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>A board of tiles, followed by a list of people, followed by the ranking of each resource for that person.
