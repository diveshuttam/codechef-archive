    "body": "<p>You are mayor of Kolkata, and you've decided to create a new town in the outskirts of the city!\n</p> \n\n<p>\nThis new town is very well planned. All the houses in the town are arranged in a rectangle of dimensions <b>n * m</b>, i.e. there are <b>n</b> rows of houses with each row containing <b>m</b> houses. The contract of painting the houses was given to a company <b>Brute Inc</b>, which did a rather lousy job. It had to paint all the houses in either red, blue or green color, but they left some of the houses unpainted.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWhen you saw the shoddy work done by the contractor, you decided to give the task of completing the unfinished painting work to another company, <b>Entropy Inc</b>. This company works in a rather weird way; It paints each unpainted house with either red, blue or green color <b>uniformly at random</b>.\n</p>\n\n<p>Consider any square shaped sub-grid of houses in this rectangular town. It can be uniquely represented by the top left house and the bottom right house. This sub-grid of houses will be called <b>beautiful</b> if all the houses in it have the same color. The overall beauty of the town will be equal to the total number of beautiful square sub-grids in the town. Your task is to find expected beauty of the town after the painting work is completed.</p>\n\n<p>A sub-grid of houses can be uniquely defined by the coordinates of top left and bottom right houses, i.e. (<b>x<sub>1</sub>, y<sub>1</sub></b>) and (<b>x<sub>2</sub>, y<sub>2</sub></b>), respectively. The houses that lie in the sub-grid will be the ones that have their coordinates <b>(x, y)</b> satisfy both <b>x<sub>1</sub> \u2264 x \u2264 x<sub>2</sub></b> and <b>y<sub>1</sub> \u2264 y \u2264 y<sub>2</sub></b>. This sub-grid will be a square sub-grid if <b>x<sub>2</sub> - x<sub>1</sub> = y<sub>2</sub> - y<sub>1</sub></b>. In particular 1 * 1 cell is also called a square sub-grid. Top left house of the town has coordinates <b>(1, 1)</b> and bottom right house has coordinates <b>(n, m)</b>. </p>\n\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>There is a single test case.</p>\n<p>The first line of the input contains two space separated integers <b>n, m</b> denoting dimensions of town.</p>\n<p>Each of the next <b>n</b> lines contains a string consisting of <b>m</b> characters, each of them can be <b>'R'</b> (denoting red color), <b>'G'</b> (denoting green color), <b>'B'</b> (denoting blue color) or <b>'*'</b> (denoting unpainted house).</p>\n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>Output a single real number corresponding to the expected beauty of the town after the painting of the houses. Your answer will be considered correct if its absolute error is within <b>1e-2</b> of the answer.</p>\n\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>n, m</b> \u2264 <b>2000</b></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Example 1</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n2 2\nRR\nRR\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n5\n</pre>\n\n<h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p>There are total 5 square sub-grids of houses in the town. All of them painted with same color. So, beauty of the town will be 5.</p>\n\n<h3>Example 2</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n2 2\nR*\nRR\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n4.33\n</pre>\n\n<h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p>The unpainted house can be painted with any of the red, green, blue colors uniformly randomly. \n<ul>\n<li>It is colored red: In this case, beauty of town will be 5.</li>\n<li>It is colored green: In this case, beauty of town will be 4.</li>\n<li>It is colored blue: In this case, beauty of town will be 4.</li>\n</ul>\n\nHence, expected beauty of the town will be <b>(5 + 4 + 4) / 3 = 13 / 3 = 4.33.</b>\n</p>",
