Of course, no two points have the same coordinates.</p>\n<p>\nTwo towers can only communicate with each other if there is no tower nor skyscraper lying on the\nstraight line segment connecting them.\n</p>\n<p>\nAs the most skillful programmer in the company, Johnny's job is to write a program to help\nByteland compute the number of pairs of towers which can communicate with each other.\n</p>\n<p>\nAnd once again, Johnny has asked for your help!\n</p>\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The first line contains a number t (about 15) which is the number of test cases. Then t test cases follow.\nEach test case has the following form.</p>\n\n<p>The first line contains two numbers N and M (1 \u2264 N, M \u2264 1000), the number of towers and skyscrapers\nin Byteland.</p>\n<p>Each line in the next N lines contains two integers representing the coordinates of the cellphone towers.</p>\n<p>Finally, each line in the next M lines contains two integers representing the coordinates of the skyscrapers.</p>\n<p>All coordinates have absolute values not larger than 10000.</p>\n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n\n<p>For each test case, print a single number, describing the number of pairs of towers which can communicate with each other.</p>\n\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre>\n<b>Input</b>\n1\n5 4\n-1 -1\n1 -1\n0 -2\n-2 -2\n0 0\n-1 -2\n1 0\n-1 1\n0 -1\n\n<b>Output</b>\n6\n</pre>\n\n<h3>Output details</h3>\n<p style='text-align:center'><img src='http://www.codechef.com/download/celltwr.png' />\n</p>\n<p>In the above figure, the blue points represent the cell towers and the red points represent the skyscrapers as in the example input. The 6 segments AE, BE, BC, AC, AD and BD correspond to the 6 pairs of towers that can communicate with each other.</p>\n\n",
