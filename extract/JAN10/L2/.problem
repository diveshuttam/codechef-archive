Therefore, he has decided to implement the \"Wildcard Matching\" feature.</p>\n<p>Wildcard matching allows ByteDict's users to search for words matching a given wildcard pattern. A wildcard pattern may include the characters '*' or '?' in addition to the characters of the alphabet. A '*' matches any sequence of characters (including the empty sequence) and a '?' matches any single character.</p>\n<p>To be more precise, a wildcard pattern is matched with a word if we can replace each '?' with an alphabet character and each '*' with a sequence of alphabet characters so that after replacement, the pattern becomes identical to the word.</p>\n<p>Now, as usual, please help Johnny implement the feature!</p>\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The first line contains a number t (about 2) which is the number of test cases. Then t test cases follow. Each test case has the following form.</p>\n<p>The first line contains two integers N and Q (1 \u2264 N \u2264 55000, 1 \u2264 Q \u2264 300) which are the number of words in the dictionary and the number of wildcard queries.</p>\n<p>Each line in the next N lines contains a word from the dictionary. The alphabet consists of lower and uppercase characters as well as digits.</p>\n<p>Each line in the next Q lines contains a wildcard pattern.</p>\n<p>The length of each word does not exceed 25 and the length of each wildcard pattern does not exceed 5.</p>\n<p>Each test case is separated by a blank line.</p>\n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>For each wildcard query print a line containing the query itself and the number of words in the dictionary that match the query.</p>\n<p>Print a blank line after each test case's output.</p>\n\n<h3>Example</h3>\n\n<pre>\n<b>Input:</b>\n2\n1 7\nabc\nabc\ncba\na??\n??a\n*?a\n***\n**a\n\n7 4\nspoj\ncodechef\nuva\ntju\nonlinejudge\nAcmicpc\nWorldcup2010\n*a*\nsp?*\n*c*\nuvc\n\n<b>Output:</b>\nabc 1\ncba 0\na?? 1\n??a 0\n*?a 0\n*** 1\n**a 0\n\n*a* 1\nsp?* 1\n*c* 3\nuvc 0\n</pre>\n",
