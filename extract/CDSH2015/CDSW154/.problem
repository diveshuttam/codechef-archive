There are <b>9</b> rows, numbered from <b>1 to 9</b> in the stadium, each having several seats. Each row as well as each guest has some priority.</p>\n<p><b>Note:</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Guest <b>1</b> is to be prioritized more than guest <b>2</b>. Similarly guest <b>2</b> is to be more prioritized than guest <b>3</b> and so on.</li>\n<li>Row <b>1</b> is superior to row<b>2</b>. Similarly row <b>2</b> is superior to row <b>3</b> and so on.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br /><br />\n<b>Arrangement Criteria:</b><br />\n<br /></p>\n<ul>\n<li>All the guests should get a seat of their choice.</li>\n<li>Each guest has a set of preferred rows in which they want a seat.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>\nSo now your work comes into play. :P<br />\nYou need to arrange them in different rows of their choice. No, its not that easy...you also need to prioritize. :)</p>\n<p>You need to find an arrangement in which guest <b>1</b> gets the seat in the best row possible out of his choice satisfying the arrangement criteria. Then you need to assign best seat to guest <b>2</b> and so on. So your task is to generate an arrangement prioritizing guests from <b>1 to N </b>in a way such that it always complies with the arrangement criteria.</p>\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>First line consists of a number <b>N</b>. </li>\n<li>Next line will have 9 space separated integers, <b>A<sub>1</sub> to A<sub>9</sub></b>, denoting empty seats in each of the 9 rows respectively.</li>\n<li>This is followed by <b>N</b> lines, each of the form <b>K</b> followed by<b> K</b> space separated integers <b>B<sub>1</sub> to B<sub>K</sub></b>  denoting the seat preference of each guest from <b>1 to N</b>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Print the <b>N</b> integers denoting the row number for each guest. If no arrangement is possible, print \"It seems MSG\" without quotes.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b> N</b>  \u2264 <b>100</b> </li>\n<li><b>1</b>  \u2264  <b>K</b>  \u2264  <b>9</b> </li>\n<li><b>0</b>  \u2264  <b>A<sub>i</sub> </b> \u2264  <b>9</b> </li>\n<li><b>1</b>  \u2264  <b>B<sub>i</sub></b>   \u2264 <b>9</b> </li>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input</b>\n5\n1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0\n5 1 2 3 4 5\n1 1\n5 1 2 3 4 5\n5 1 2 3 4 5\n5 1 2 3 4 5\n\n<b>Output</b>\n2 1 3 4 5\n</pre>\n<h3>Explanation</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Guest 1 should be allotted row 1 but as guest 2 has only row 1 as preference so we will not be able to arrange them. So guest 2 will be allotted row 1. Then Guest 1 will be allotted Row 2 followed by row 3 to guest 3, row 4 to guest 4 and row 5 to guest 5 as guest 3 has high priority than Guest 4 and Guest 5. </li>\n</ul>\n",
