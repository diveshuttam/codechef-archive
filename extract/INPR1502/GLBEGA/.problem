On the table, there are two bowls \ufb01lled with glass beads. In each move, depending on whose turn it is, you or your opponent can do one of the following.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Move one bead from the \ufb01rst bowl to the second bowl</li>\n<li>Remove one bead from the second bowl.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>At any point in the game, let x denote the number of beads in the \ufb01rst bowl and y denote the number of beads in the second bowl. If x + y is even, it is your turn to move. If x + y is odd, it is your opponent\u2019s turn to move</p>\n<p>At each position of the game, you get some points that depend on the number of beads, x and y, in the two bowls. This is given by a function f(x, y) = Ax<sup>2</sup> + By<sup>2</sup> + Cxy, where A, B and C are integers that are \ufb01xed each time the game is played.</p>\n<p>The game starts with M beads in the \ufb01rst bowl and N beads in the second bowl. As the game progresses, beads are removed. The game ends when both bowls are empty.</p>\n<p>Your score for the game is the sum of the values f(x, y) for each position (x, y) that the game passes through, starting from (M, N) and ending with (0, 0). Your aim is to obtain as high a score as possible, no matter what moves your opponent chooses. Remember that your opponent is \ufb01endishly ingenious and will always play in such a way as to minimize your score.</p>\n<p>For example, suppose the game starts with 2 beads in each bowl and the score function\u00a0is f(x, y) = x<sup>2</sup> \u2212 y<sup>2</sup> \u2212 xy: that is, A = 1, B = \u22121 and C = \u22121. Here are some plays of\u00a0the game\u2014the positions where you choose the move are enclosed in boxes and the positions\u00a0where your opponent moves are not enclosed in boxes.<br />\n<img src=\"/download/extimages/527ffcdf26a5a9d5ef96fec4f7ca6b40.png\" width=\"450px;\" /><br />\n<br />\nIn this particular game, the best possible score that you can achieve if you consider all\u00a0possible moves that your opponent can choose is \u221222. Recall that your devilishly clever\u00a0opponent always plays in such a way that your score is minimized.</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The input consists of a single line containing \ufb01ve integers, M, N, A, B and C where M and N are the number of beads initially in the \ufb01rst and second bowl, respectively and A, B and C are the coe\ufb03cients of the score function f(x, y) = Ax<sup>2</sup> + By<sup>2</sup> + Cxy.</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>The output should be a single integer, the maximum score that you can achieve in this game.</p>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>M,N</b> \u2264 <b>600</b></li>\n<li><b>-1000</b>\u2264<b>A,B,C</b>\u2264<b>1000</b></li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<p><b>Input:</b><br />\n2 2 1 -1 -1</p>\n<p><b>Output:</b></p>\n<p>-22<font face=\"sans-serif, Arial, Verdana, Trebuchet MS\"><span style=\"white-space: normal;\"> </span></font></p>\n",
