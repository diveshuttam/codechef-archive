One day when he was looking for a book in library, he came across a book named <b>Formule Di Matematica</b>. He found it interesting and started reading it. While going through the book, he found a function <b>D</b> which was as following:<br><br><b>\nD(< a<sub>1</sub>,a<sub>2</sub>,a<sub>3</sub>,..,a<sub>n</sub> >) = |a<sub>1</sub>-a<sub>2</sub>| + |a<sub>2</sub>-a<sub>3</sub>| + ... +|a<sub>n-1</sub>-a<sub>n</sub>| </b><br>\nwhere < a<sub>1</sub>,a<sub>2</sub>,a<sub>3</sub>,...,an</sub> > is a sequence of n distinct integers.<br><br>Ramanujan quickly understood that the value of D would depend upon the order of integers, hence he was then interested in finding out what could possibly be the maximum value of D, given a set of Integers S.\nIt's given that, S = set of all possible permutation you can make with n different integers and the range of integers would be [1...n]. \nNow help Ramanujan to find the maximum value of D which can be obtained, if he tries each and every permutation from the set S as an argument for D.\n</p>\n\n\n<b>Input:</b>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\";>\nThere will be T<=10<sup>5</sup> test cases. For each case there is a single line. First line contains an integer 1<=n<=10<sup>9</sup> which specifies the number of distinct integers. The integers are in the range [1..n].\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\";>\n<b>Output:</b><br>\nFor each test case you have to output the required answer in a single line.The output will fit in 64-bit signed integer.\n</p>\n\n<h3>Example:</h3>\n<pre>\n<b>Input:</b>\n2\n1\n2\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n0\n1\n</pre>",
