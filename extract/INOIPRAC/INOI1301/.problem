To amuse himself, he decides to play the following game : he draws a sequence of N squares on the ground, numbered 1 to N, and writes an integer in each square. He starts at square k (1 \u2264 k \u2264 N). The game consists of one forward phase followed by one backward phase.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>In the forward phase, Calvin makes zero or more moves of the following type : if his current position is p, he can jump to p+1 or p+2 as long as he stays within the N squares.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In the backward phase, Calvin makes zero or more moves of the following type : if his current position is p, he can jump to p\u22121 or p\u22122 as long as he stays within the N squares.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>He plays such that he finally ends up at square 1, and then he stops. He starts with a score of 0, and each time he jumps from square i to square j, he adds the integer written in square j to his score. Find the maximum score Calvin can obtain by playing this game. Recall that Calvin must start at square k and end at square 1. The integer on the square where he starts is not included in his score.</p>\n<p>For example, suppose N = 5 and the numbers in squares are 5, 3, \u22122, 1, 1. If k = 2, Calvin starts on the second square. He can make a forward move to square 4, another to square 5, a backward move to square 4, another to square 2, and another to square 1. His total score is 1+1+1+3+5 = 11. You can check that this is the maximum score possible.</p>\n<h3>Input format</h3>\n<p>\u2022 Line 1 : Two space-separated integers, N and k, with 1 \u2264 k \u2264 N.<br /> \u2022 Line 2 : A space-separated sequence of N integers, the numbers in squares 1, 2 . . . , N .</p>\n<h3>Output format</h3>\n<p>A single line with a single integer, the maximum score Calvin can obtain by playing the game.</p>\n<h3>Test Data</h3>\n<p>The testdata is grouped into two subtasks with the following constraints on the inputs.</p>\n<p>\u2022 <strong>Subtask 1</strong> [30 points] : 1 \u2264 N \u2264 3000.</p>\n<p>\u2022 <strong>Subtask 2</strong> [70 points] : 1 \u2264 N \u2264 10<sup>6</sup>.</p>\n<p>In all subtasks, the number in each square is between \u22121000 and 1000 inclusive.</p>\n</div>\n<div title=\"Page 2\">\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<div>\n<p>Here is the sample input and output corresponding to the example above.</p>\n<h3>Sample input</h3>\n<pre>5 2\n5 3 -2 1 1\n</pre>\n<h3>Sample output</h3>\n<pre>11\n</pre>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: Your program should not print anything other than what is specified in the output format.
