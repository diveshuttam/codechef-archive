As he is very interested in Mathematics, he decides to develop a new number system which he would name after himself. Unlike the other \u201ctraditional\u201d number systems, his system does not have \u201clow-level\u201d relationships like successors, predecessors etc. Rather the system is modeled in such a way that it has entities represented by numbers which are related via very complex classes and a mathematical relation <b>R</b>.</p>\n<p>The relation <b>R</b> is symmetric i.e. if <b> a R b </b>, then <b> b R a</b> but is not transitive.\n</p>\n<p>He then asks his arch-rival Ted to solve a problem in this number system. The problem is to find a subset of a given set of <b>N</b> entities which satisfies the following property.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>For every element <b>a</b> in this subset, the number of distinct elements in the subset which are related to <b>a</b> with the relation <b>R</b> is at-least <b>K</b>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Ted, being a phony, runs to you for help. Help him in finding such a subset.</p>\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p> The first line of input contains three space separated integers, <b>N</b>, the number of distinct entities, <b>M</b>, the number of different class relations and <b>K</b>, the size of this subset. Each of the <b>M</b> lines that follow contains two integers <b>a</b> and <b>b</b>, meaning that <b>a</b> and <b>b</b> are related by relation R.</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p> For each test case, output a single line containing an integer <b>S</b>, the size of such a maximum subset. If such a subset is not possible, output 0.</p>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>N</b> \u2264 <b>10^5</b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>M</b> \u2264 <b>min{n*(n-1)/2, 5*10^5}</b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>K</b> \u2264 <b>N</b></li>\n<li><b>0</b> \u2264 <b>a,b</b> \u2264 <b>N-1</b></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n3 3 2\n0 1\n0 2\n1 2\n<b>Output:</b>\n3\n</pre>\n",
