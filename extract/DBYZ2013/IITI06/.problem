Professor Flitwick has entrusted Harry with the decoration of the giant ballroom. The ballroom will be decorated with <b>N</b> drapes (numbered from 1 to <b>N</b>). The height of the ith drape is <b>A[i]</b>. The drapes are sorted in non-increasing order of height (<b>A[i]</b>>=<b>A[i+1]</b> for all <b>i</b> where 1 &lt;= <b>i</b> &lt;<b>N</b>). There are <b>N</b> colours (numbered from 1 to <b>N</b>) available for decoration. Each drape must be coloured using one of these <b>N</b> colours. The cost of colouring drape <b>i</b> with colour <b>c</b> is <b>A[i]*c</b>.</p>\n<p>Decorating the ballroom is a big responsibility and so Professor Flitwick has decided to first test Harry to ensure that he is up to the task. Professor Flitwick will ask Harry <b>Q</b> queries, each of which Harry must answer correctly. Each query consists of 3 integers : <b>l</b>, <b>r</b> and <b>k</b>. This means that only the drapes numbered from <b>l</b> to <b>r</b> (inclusive) must be coloured such that the total cost of the colouring is atmost <b>k</b>. Harry's objective is to make the colouring as colourful as possible. The colourfulness of a colouring is defined as the number of distinct colours which appear atleast once in the colouring. The objective is to return the maximum possible colourfulness under the cost constraint.</p>\n<p>Formally, if <b>C</b> is a colouring of the drapes from <b>l</b> to <b>r</b> (inclusive) and <b>c</b> is a colour, f(<b>c</b>,<b>C</b>)=1 if there is atleast one drape which is coloured with colour <b>c</b> under the colouring <b>C</b>. Otherwise f(<b>c</b>,<b>C</b>)=0. colourfulness(<b>C</b>) is defined as the sum of <b>f(1,<b>C</b>)+f(2,<b>C</b>)+....+f(N,C)</b>. cost(<b>C</b>) is the sum of the costs of colouring the drapes from <b>l</b> to <b>r</b> (inclusive) (The cost of colouring a single drape is defined above). The correct answer to the query is the maximum value of colourfulness(<b>C</b>) over all colourings <b>C</b> which satisfy cost(<b>C</b>)&lt;=<b>k</b>. If there is no valid colouring which satisfies cost(<b>C</b>)&lt;=<b>k</b>, then the correct answer to the query is \"-1\" (quotes for clarity).</p>\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The first line of input contains a single integer <b>N</b>.<br />\nThe second line contains <b>N</b> integers, <b>A[1], A[2] .. A[N]</b>. These will be sorted in non-increasing order.<br />\nThe third line countains a single integer <b>Q</b>.<br />\n<b>Q</b> lines follow. Each of these lines consists of 3 space-seperated integers : <b>l</b>,<b>r</b>,<b>k</b>.</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>Correctly formatted output consists of <b>Q</b> lines. The ith line contains a single integer : the answer to the ith query.<br />\nNote : If the cost constraint does not permit any colouring, the answer is -1.\n</p>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<p>1&lt;=<b>N</b>&lt;=5000<br /><br />\n1&lt;=<b>A[i]</b>&lt;=10^9<br /><br />\n1&lt;=<b>Q</b>&lt;=100000<br /><br />\n1&lt;=<b>l</b>&lt;=<b>r</b>&lt;=<b>N</b><br /><br />\n0&lt;=<b>k</b>&lt;=10^18<br />\n</p>\n\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n<p>6\n12 8 6 3 2 1\n3\n1 4 28\n1 4 40\n1 4 200\n</p>\n<b>Output:</b>\n<p>-1\n2\n4\n</p>\n</pre>\n<h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p>1.The minimum cost of colouring the drapes numbered from 1 to 4 is 12+8+6+3=29. So the answer to the first query is -1.<br /><br />\n2.One way to use 2 distinct colours to colour the drapes from 1 to 4 is to colour drape 3 with colour 2 and the rest with colour 1. The cost of this equals 12+8+6*2+3=35.<br /><br />\n3.Since the cost constraint is large, we can afford to keep all 4 colours distinct.</p>\n",
