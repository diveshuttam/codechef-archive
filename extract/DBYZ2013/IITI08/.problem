Today's class has a long table on which <b>N</b> elemental potions (numbered from 1 to <b>N</b>) are arranged. The queerness of the ith potion is <b>A[i]</b>. A unique bipotion can be obtained by mixing together small quantities of exactly two distinct elemental potions. Each unordered pair of distinct elemental potions corresponds to a different bipotion. The queerness of a bipotion is the product of the queernesses of the two elemental potions from which it was obtained.</p>\n<p>Professor Snape performs <b>Q</b> actions during the course of the class. The ith action is specified by 3 integers, as follows : <br /><br />\n0 <b>q1</b> <b>q2</b> : He replaces the potion at the <b>q1</b>'th position with a potion of queerness <b>q2</b>. <br />1 <b>q1</b> <b>q2</b> : He points to two potions <b>q1</b> and <b>q2</b> (st <b>q1</b>&lt;<b>q2</b>). In response to this, Harry must report the total queerness of all possible bipotions that can be obtained using the elemental potions numbered from <b>q1</b> to <b>q2</b> (inclusive).</p>\n<p>Harry gets a detention if he answers any of the queries wrongly. You must help him to avoid getting one.</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The first line of input consists of a single integer <b>N</b>.<br />\nThe second line contains <b>N</b> integers, <b>A[1], A[2] .. A[N]</b>. (Note that potions are allowed to have negative queerness.)<br />\nThe third line contains a single integer <b>Q</b>.<br />\n<b>Q</b> lines follow. Each of these lines consists of 3 space-seperated integers : <b>tp</b>,<b>q1</b>,<b>q2</b>.\n</p>\n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>Correctly formatted output consists of one line for each action with <b>tp</b>=1. Each of these lines must consist of a single integer: the number that Harry must report in response to that particular action.\n</p>\n\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<p>2&lt;=<b>N</b>&lt;=100000<br /><br />\n-1000&lt;=<b>A[i]</b>&lt;=1000<br /><br />\n1&lt;=<b>Q</b>&lt;=100000<br /><br />\n0&lt;=<b>tp</b>&lt;=1<br /><br />\nif <b>tp</b>=0, 1&lt;=<b>q1</b>&lt;=<b>N</b> and -1000&lt;=<b>q2</b>&lt;=1000<br /><br />\nif <b>tp</b>=1, 1&lt;=<b>q1</b>&lt;<b>q2</b>&lt;=<b>N</b><br />\n</p>\n\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n5\n5 4 3 2 1\n3\n1 2 4\n0 3 7\n1 2 4 \n\n<b>Output:</b>\n26\n50\n</pre>\n<h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p>The queerness sequence at the time of the first query is [5,4,3,2,1].<br />\nThe queried section is [4,3,2].<br />\n2*3 + 3*4 + 2*4 = 6 + 12 + 8 = 26.<br />\nThe queerness sequence at the time of the first query is [5,4,7,2,1].<br />\nThe queried section is [4,7,2].<br />\n2*7 + 7*4 + 2*4 = 50.</p>\n",
