The game involves<br />\n  a pile of coins. Both players take turns in picking a certain number of coins<br />\n  from the pile. Initially, the pile contains <b>N</b> coins. Alice makes the first<br />\n  move. The player who is unable to pick up any coins in his/her turn loses the<br />\n  game. Some of the details of the game are:</p>\n<p></p>\n<ol>\n<li>In each turn a player can only decide on picking up <b>1, 4, 9, 16</b> coins from the<br />\n  pile.</li>\n<p></p>\n<li>As both the players are drunk and not in complete control of their actions,<br />\n  even if they decide on picking up some coins, they might end up picking<br />\n  something else completely. So, if a person decides on picking up <b>X</b> coins from<br />\n  the pile, he/she might end up with <b>(X - 1), X or (X + 1)</b> coins with the<br />\n  relative probability of<b> C1: C2: C3</b></li>\n<p></p>\n<li>In each turn a player has to eventually pick up at least <b>1</b> coin.</li>\n</ol>\n<p></p>\n<p>Note that a player cannot decide on picking up <b>X</b> coins from the pile if the<br />\n  pile contains less than <b>X</b> coins at the time. Also, if a player decided on<br />\n  picking up <b>X</b> coins and it happens that picking up <b>(X + 1)</b> is not valid (This<br />\n  might happen if there are only <b>X</b> coins in the pile), then the relative<br />\n  probability distribution for the valid moves will be <b>C1: C2</b>. Similarly, if<br />\n  picking up <b>(X - 1)</b> coins is not valid, then the relative probability<br />\n  distribution for the valid moves will be <b>C2: C3</b>.</p>\n<p>  As both of them are not in their right minds, they sometimes want to win and<br />\n  sometimes want to lose. But Bob still wonders what is his probability of<br />\n  winning/losing the game (depending on what he wants for a particular game).<br />\n  Help him find out his probability!\n  </p>\n<h3>Input Format:</h3>\n<p>\n  The first line of the input contains a single integer, <b>T</b>, which represents the<br />\n  number of test cases. Each test case contains <b>3</b> lines. The first line of each<br />\n  test contains a single integer, <b>N</b>, which represents the number of coins in the<br />\n  pile initially. The second line contains 3 integers <b>C1, C2 and C3</b>. The last<br />\n  line of each test contains <b>2</b> integers describing the mood of Alice and Bob<br />\n  respectively. <b>0</b> is for losing and <b>1</b> is for winning.\n  </p>\n<h3>Output Format:</h3>\n<p>\n  For each test cases, the probability of winning/losing (depending on the test<br />\n  case) rounded to <b>4</b> places of precision.\n  </p>\n<h3>Constraints:</h3>\n<p><b><br />\n  1 \u2264 T \u2264 10<br />\n  1 \u2264 N \u2264 1000000<br />\n  1 \u2264  (C1,C2,C3) \u2264  100000<br /></b>\n  </p>\n<h3>Sample Input:</h3>\n<pre>\n2\n1\n1 2 3\n0 0\n5\n1 2 3\n0 1</pre><h3>Sample Output:</h3>\n<pre>\n1.0000\n0.4333</pre><p><br />\n<b>Problem Setter: Sukhjashan Singh</b></p>\n",
