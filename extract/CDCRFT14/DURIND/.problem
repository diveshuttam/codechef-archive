R. R. Tolkien decided to make Thorin Oakenshield\u2019s task more difficult.<br />\n  This time he was given an infinite number of keys represented by a small<br />\n  string. The hidden entrance has a lot of keyholes side by side represented by<br />\n  one long string. The key fits only into a slit that matches it completely.<br />\n  Oakenshield does not know how many keys he would require and which all<br />\n  keyholes he will have to try out. So if there are <b>n</b> keyholes where the key<br />\n  fits, he might need any number of keys between <b>1 to n</b> (both inclusive).<br />\n  Moreover he does not know which keyholes among the ones where the keys fit, he<br />\n  will have to use. All he knows is that there is a unique way to open the door.<br />\n  Trying out each configuration takes <b>1</b> second. The last light of Durin\u2019s day<br />\n  does not last long and will have to try out all possibilities before it goes.<br />\n  He wants you to find out how long, in the worst case, it will take for him to<br />\n  try out all possibilities.</p>\n<p>  Since the answers may be huge, output it modulo <b>1000000007</b>.<br />\n  If there are no keyholes where the key fits, output <b>0</b>.\n  </p>\n<h3>Input Format:</h3>\n<p>\n  First line containing a string representing the key.<br />\n  Second line containing a string representing the keyholes.\n  </p>\n<h3>Output Format:</h3>\n<p>\n  Single line containing an integer for the required answer.\n  </p>\n<h3>Notes:</h3>\n<p>\n  1. Key fits into a keyhole at index <b>i</b> if key is a substring of keyhole string<br />\n  at index <b>i</b>.<br />\n  2. If there are two overlapping keyholes where the key may fit, you cannot<br />\n  insert a key in both simultaneously\n  </p>\n<h3>Constraints:</h3>\n<p><b><br />\n  1 &le; key &le; 10^4<br />\n  1 &le; keyholes &le; 5*(10^5)<br /></b>\n\t</p>\n<h3>Sample Input:</h3>\n<pre>\nc\na\t</pre><h3>Sample Output:</h3>\n<pre>\n0</pre><h3>Sample Input:</h3>\n<pre>\naba\nabababa</pre><h3>Sample Output:</h3>\n<pre>\n4</pre><h3>Explanation:</h3>\n<p></p><p><b>Explanation for Test Case #1:<br /></b><br />\n  The key fits into keyholes at positions {1, 3, 5}<br />\n  If he requires only 1 key he may put them at {1} or {3} or {5} = 3 seconds.<br />\n  If he required 2 keys, he may put them at {1,5} = 1 second.<br />\n  Total = 1+3 = 4 seconds.<br />\n  He cannot use 3 keys without overlapping them.</p>\n<p> <b> Explanation for Test Case #2:<br /></b><br />\n  There is no slit where the key fits hence 0 seconds.</p>\n\n<p><br />\n<b>Problem Setter: Vidit Gupta</b></p>\n",
