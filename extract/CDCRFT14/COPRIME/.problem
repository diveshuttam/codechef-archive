He is given two random arrays <b>A</b> and <b>B</b><br />\n  consisting of <b>N</b> positive integer elements. Game starts by Mr. Yagami assigning <b>0 or 1</b><br />\n  to each element in <b>A and B</b>.</p>\n<p>After this assignment is done, a graph is constructed with a node for each<br />\n  element in the array A and B (<b>2N</b> nodes) and no edges. The game proceeds with a<br />\n  valid move being defined in the following way:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>  One of the arrays from <b>A</b> or <b>B</b> is selected.<br />\n  From the selected array, an element which has been marked <b>0</b> is chosen. Let us<br />\n  call this element as <b>X</b>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A set of elements, <b>Y</b>, are chosen from the array, which was not chosen in the<br />\n  first step, such that all elements of <b>Y</b> should be marked as <b>1</b> and all elements<br />\n  of <b>Y</b> should be greater than <b>X</b> and no element of<b> Y</b> should be coprime to <b>X</b>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Finally an edge is drawn from the node labelled <b>X</b> to all the nodes<br />\n  corresponding to the elements in set <b>Y</b>. There can only be a single edge<br />\n  between any <b>2</b> nodes in the graph.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>  He can make as many valid moves. Mr. Yagami receives <b>1</b> point for each edge<br />\n  that is drawn in the graph.</p>\n<p>  Mr. Yagami is very clever, so he makes the initial assignment in such a way<br />\n  that it maximizes the number of points he receives in the game. You have to<br />\n  return the maximum number of points that Mr. Yagami can receive.\n  </p>\n<h3>Input Format:</h3>\n<p>\n  The first line of the input contains a single integer, <b>N (1 \u2264 N \u2264<br />\n  40)</b><br />\n  The second line of input contains <b>N</b> integers separated by a single space<br />\n  character, which represent the elements of the array <b>A. (2 \u2264 A[i] &le;  10^9)</b><br />\n  Similarly, the last line of input also contains <b>N</b> integers separated by a<br />\n  single space character, which represent the elements of the array <b>B. (2 \u2264<br />\n  B[i] \u2264 10^9)</b>\n  </p>\n<h3>Output Format:</h3>\n<p>\n  A single integer representing the maximum score which Mr. Yagami can receive.\n  </p>\n<h3>Sample Input:</h3>\n<pre>\n4\n16 3 2 9\n12 18 13 4</pre><h3>Sample Output:</h3>\n<pre>\n8</pre><h3>Explanation:</h3>\n<p>\n  He picks 2 from first array. So he gets to put 3 edges ie. 2->4, 2->12,<br />\n  2->18.<br />\t<br />\n  Next he picks 3 from the first array. So he gets to put 2 edges ie. 3->12,<br />\n  3->18.<br />\n  Next he picks 9 from the first array. So he gets to put 2 edges ie. 9->12,<br />\n  9->18.<br />\n  Next he picks 16 from the first array. So he gets to put 1 edge ie. 16->18.<br />\n  Total edges=8.\n  </p>\n<p><br />\n<b>Problem Setter: Lalit Kundu</b></p>\n",
