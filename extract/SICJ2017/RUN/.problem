Due to her asthma problem, at i<sup>th</sup> day she can run up to at most X distance. Suppose there are N days in a year. Assume she run optimally, you need to output the minimum day number to reach the destination</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The first input line contains the <b>T</b> number of test cases. Each testcase consist of three lines First line consist of single integer <b>N</b> \u2014 the number of days in a year.<br>\nNext line contains <b>N</b> non-negative space-separated numbers\u2014 i.e. distance which Anjali will run on ith day. At least one of the numbers is greater than zero.<br>\nAnd the third line consist of the value of total Distance <b>M</b> which Anjali has to cover.\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>For each testcase you need to output the answer to the following query.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<p></p>\n<ul>\n<li>1<=T<= 10</li>\n<li>1<=N<=10^5</li>\n<li>0<=X<=10^8</li>\n<li>0<=M<=10^16</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n2\n5\n1 5 0 0 2\n9\n3\n1 3 0\n2\n<b>Output:</b>\n1\n2\n</pre>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p>For first testcase distance M is 9 units. <br>\nOn the 1st day distance covered is 1 unit.<br>\nOn the 2nd day  distance covered is 5 units.<br>\nOn 3rd and 4th day distance covered is 0 units. <br>\nOn the 5th day distance covered is 2 units. <br>\nSo total distance covered till 5th day is 8 units.<br>\nThen she will go to the first day of the next year.<br>\nSo total distance covered till 1st day will be 9 units.<br>\nSo answer is 1.<br>\n<br>\nSimilarly answer for second testcase is 2.</p>",
