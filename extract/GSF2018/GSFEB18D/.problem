If the number of vowels <i>(a, e, i, o, u)</i> in both the question and her answer is same then Mean-akshi is telling the truth else she is lying. Mean-akshi will be asked question for N continuous times. If she is telling truth more than or equal to number of times she lied print <b>jane</b> else print <b>secretbff</b> (without spaces between secret and bff).\n\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The first line of the input contains an integer <b>T</b> denoting the number of test cases.<br>\nThe subsequent lines contain integer <b>N</b> denoting the number of questions.<br> \nEach <b>N</b> will have 2N lines in total i.e. the first line will be the question <b>S</b> followed by the second line which will be it's answer <b>M</b>.Thus, there'll be N pairs of Question and Answer.\n</p>\n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>For each test case, output the answer as given below.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>T</b> \u2264 <b>100</b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>N</b> \u2264 <b>10</b>.
