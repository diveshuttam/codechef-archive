Also, Chef has to buy an item, as a whole, indivisible entity, depending on the capacity of the basket and every item to be bought should have quantity as one only. Each item will yield Chef a specific profit.</p>\n<p>Help Chef decide which item he needs to select, keeping in mind that the end goal is to maximize profit, while keeping the total weight of items chosen, to be at the most, the capacity of the basket.</p>\n\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The first line of the input contains an integer <b>T</b> denoting the number of test cases.</li>\n<li>The next line contains input <b>N</b> specifying number of items and <b>M</b> denoting capacity of the basket.</li>\n<li>The third line consists of p<sub>1</sub>, p<sub>2</sub>, ...p<sub>N</sub>, and specifies the profit yielded by each item.</li>\n<li>Similarly, the fourth line consists of w<sub>1</sub>, w<sub>2</sub>, ...w<sub>N</sub>, and specifies the weight of each item.</li></ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>\nFor each test case, output a single line containing maximum profit earned by Chef, by selecting items from the given list.\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>T</b> \u2264 <b>100</b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>N , p<sub>i</sub> , w<sub>i</sub> , M </b> \u2264 <b>10<sup>3</sup></b></li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n1\n4 7\n1 4 5 7 \n1 3 4 5\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n9\n</pre>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n",
