One day Rohit decides to give Dwij a problem to test his coding skills. Unfortunately, the problem is too difficult for him,so he asks you to help him out.\n<br><br>\nHe has a map of a city which can be represented as a <b>weighted tree with N nodes</b>,representing houses, numbered from <b>1 to N</b> where each node is given a number from <b>1 to K</b> which denotes the family that lives in the house and the roads between the houses are denoted by edges where weight of an edge represents the amount of tax one has to pay for using that road.\n<br><br>\nOn any special occasion the families visit their relatives in the city, two families with same value of <b>K</b> are said to be relatives. A given family starts from their home and visits one of the relative and then head back home before going to meet another relative. While doing so they have to pay the tax associated with a given road they travelled. Given the description of the city, you need to find the total amount of money a family spends.\n</p>\n\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p></p>\n<ul>\n<li>First line consists of an integer <b>T</b> , denoting number of testcases.</li>\n<li>First line of each testcase consists of two space seperated integers <b>N</b> and <b>K</b> denoting number of houses and number of families respectively.</li>\n<li>Second line of each testcase contains <b>N</b> space seperated integers denoting the value of <b>K</b> for each house. The next <b>N-1</b> lines consists of three integers <b>A B C</b> denoting a road from house <b>A to B</b> with <b>C</b> amount of tax associated with it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p></p>\n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\nFor every test case output a single line with K space seperated integers denoting the amount of tax paid by family of type i modulo 10^9+7,1<= i <=K\n</ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<p></p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b> T </b> \u2264 <b>100</b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>N</b> \u2264 <b>10^5</b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>K</b> \u2264 <b>MIN(N,500)</b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>A,B</b> \u2264 <b>N</b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>C</b> \u2264 <b>10^9</b></li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n\n1\n10 2\n1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2\n1 9 10\n10 9 20\n9 8 15\n8 2 30\n8 7 50\n8 3 35\n3 5 90\n3 4 80\n5 6 100\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n\n1800 3100\n\n</pre>",
