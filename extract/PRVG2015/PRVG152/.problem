On the Gulmohar marg which has plenty of trees in a line, he has decided to hang colourful bells. The trees on the road are numbered 1,2,3,... . He has decided to hang a bell of colour <b>i</b> on all trees numbered by a multiple of <b>i</b>. There is however a limit on the number of bells that can hang from a tree. Harshit hangs the bells from the first tree onwards. As soon as he reaches a tree with as many bells to be hung as the capacity, he hangs the bells on that tree and stops.  Given the capacity of the trees N, determine how many trees are decorated. There are bells of all colours from 1 to 10^20</p>\n<p>Update: (This papragraph was not a part of the question previously and is a correction) Harshith stops hanging the bells only when he sees a tree with exactly as many bells to be hanged as the 'capacity'. There may be trees before that in which he hangs strictly more bells than the 'capacity'. </p>\n<p><b>\n<p>Input:</p>\n<p></p></b></p>\n<p>The first line of the input gives the number of test cases <b>T</b>.</p>\n<p>The next T lines contain a single number <b>N</b>, the number of bells that can be hung from a tree.</p>\n<p><b>\n<p>Output:</p>\n<p></p></b></p>\n<p>The output to each test case should be on a new line. On each of the <b>T</b> lines there should be one integer, the number of trees. If the number of trees is greater than 2^60, then the integer displayed should be 2^60.</p>\n<p><b>\n<p>Input constraints:</p>\n<p></p></b></p>\n<p>0&lt;<b>T</b>&lt;10^4</p>\n<p>0&lt;<b>N</b>&lt;10000</p>\n<p><b>\n<p>Sample input:</p>\n<p></p></b></p>\n<p>3</p>\n<p>1</p>\n<p>4</p>\n<p>9999</p>\n<p><b>\n<p>Sample output:</p>\n<p></p></b></p>\n<p>1</p>\n<p>6</p>\n<p>1152921504606846976</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>(2^60 = 1152921504606846976)</p>\n",
