In doing so she sometimes uses her most effective technique called shedding tears. This technique has always worked and everyone around her turns their attention towards her when she uses it.<br/><br/><br />\nBhavuk is quite accustomed to this technique and has become a professional in shedding tears. But these days she is finding it difficult to do so and requires few drops of a catalyst to flood her cheeks. <br/><br/><br />\nTo grab the attention of everyone around, bhavuk has to shed <b>S</b> tears. Each drop of catalyst <b>C</b> helps her to shed two tears and she has a natural ability to shed <b>N</b> tears without using the catalyst.<br/><br/><br />\nGiven the number of tears <b>S</b> to be shed, the natural ability of shedding <b>N</b> tears and the volume(in drops) of catalyst <b>C</b> present with bhavuk, find out whether bhavuk is able to become the center of attention.\n</br/></br/></br/></br/></br/></br/></p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>\nFirst line of input contains <b>T</b> - the number of test cases.<br/><br />\nEach test case consists of 3 numbers <b>S N C</b><br/><br />\n<b>S</b> - number tears to be shed<br/><br />\n<b>N</b> - number of tears that can be shed naturally<br/><br />\n<b>C</b> - Volume(in drops) of catalyst\n</br/></br/></br/></br/></p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>For every test case output \"NO\" if it is not possible for bhavuk to be the center of attention or \"YES\" followed by the drops of catalyst used. </p>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<p>\n<b>1</b>&lt;=<b>T</b>&lt;=<b>1000</b><br/><br />\n<b>0</b>&lt;=<b>S</b>&lt;=<b>100000</b><br/><br />\n<b>0</b>&lt;=<b>N</b>&lt;=<b>100000</b><br/><br />\n<b>0</b>&lt;=<b>C</b>&lt;=<b>100000</b>\n</br/></br/></br/></p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n\n3\n5 1 4\n100 99 1\n100 1 2\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n\nYES 2\nYES 1\nNO\n</pre>",
