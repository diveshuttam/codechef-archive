He wandered about for a while and eventually came upon two strange old men<br />\nwho were playing Go, their board resting on a rock between them. Wang Chih was fascinated. He put down his axe and began to watch.<br />\nOne of the players gave him something like a date to chew on, so that he felt neither hunger nor thirst. As he continued to watch he<br />\nfell into a trance for what seemed like an hour or two. When he awoke, however, the two old men were no longer there.<br />\nHe found that his axe handle had rotted to dust and he had grown a long beard. When he returned to his native village he discovered<br />\nthat his family had disappeared and that no one even remembered his name.\n</p>\n<p>\nSo how could that happen? Well, that's because the game \"Go\" can played very long.\n</p>\n<p>\nLet's first define the game \"Go\":\n</p>\n<p>\nIn this game, we focus on the game played on a 9x9 board. It is a game played by 2 players.<br />\nA plays black stone while B plays white. They play alternatively. A goes first.<br />\nIn each cell there can be 3 states: empty, having 1 black stone and having 1 white stone.\n</p>\n<p>\nIf we link the same color stones which are neighbourhood (|x1-x2| + |y1-y2| = 1), we can get some connected component.<br />\nWe say a connected component is dead if no stone in it has an empty neighbourhood cell.</p>\n<p>\nIn each move, the player must put the stone on an empty cell or pass the turn. If this player put a stone, following situation will<br />\nhappen. </p>\n<ol>\n</ol>\n<li>If after this move there is at least one connected component of opponent dead, then stones from these dead components<br />\nwill be removed. (In this case, after remove all dead components of your opponent, we can prove all your connected component are not dead.)</li>\n<li> Otherwise, if there are at least one connected component of yours dead, then this move is invalid.</li>\n<p>\nIn order to avoid infinite loops, there is a rule called \"No same state\". The state of board can be expressed as a string with length 82:<br />\nthe first character indicate who is the next player, then 9*9 character indicate the state of a certain cell. If after one move the game<br />\ngoes into a state that previously occurred, then this move is invalid.<br />\n</p>\n<p>\nYou are given an integer N. Please output a match that contains N valid moves for both player.\n</p>\n<p>\nYou can find details for the rules in the judge program<br />\n<a href=\"https://codechef_shared.s3.amazonaws.com/download/RANKA_JUDGE.cpp\">here</a>.\n</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>Only line of input will contain an integer denoting <b>N</b>.</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>You must output N lines.<br />\nIf the player uses \"pass\" at that step, then output \"0 0\", otherwise output the coordinate \"x y\" where 1 \u2264 x,y \u2264 9.\n</p>\n<h3>Constraints and Subtasks</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Subtask1 (20 points) : <b>N  = 5000</b></li>\n<li>Subtask2 (80 points) : <b>N  = 10000</b></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n12\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n1 1\n2 1\n2 2\n1 2\n1 3\n2 3\n1 1\n3 2\n0 0\n1 2\n9 9\n2 2\n</pre><h3>Examples</h3>\n<p>\nHere are some examples: <br />\nYou can see the image at this <a href=\"/download/extimages/dff1e253b0a327c9f60f79ec80e10fb1.png\">link</a> if itis not properly visible in your browser.<br />\n<br /> \n</p>\n<p>\n<img src=\"/download/extimages/dff1e253b0a327c9f60f79ec80e10fb1.png\"  width=\"750\" />\n</p>\n",
