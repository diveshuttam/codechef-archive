Both are very much excited to attend the $MEGA SHOW of SANDHAAN'18$. But unfortunately, they have only one ticket. So, they decided to play a game and the winner of the game will get the ticket. The name of the game is -\"Rotate the string\".\n\nThey took a string of characters and started rotating it. A $k$-rotation on a string takes  the trailing $k$ characters of the string and attaches it to the beginning of the string in the same order.  For eg.- 4 rotation on the string \"understand\" results in the string \"tandunders\". On the given string $S$,  Swati performs $M$ rotation and gives it to Neha. Neha performs a $P$ rotation on it and gives back to Swati. Swati again performs $M$ rotation on it and so on.... Anyone rotation brings the original string $S$ back, she will be the winner.  This can happen after a rotation performed by Swati or Neha. Let help her to decide.\n\n###Input:\n\n- First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. \n- Each testcase consists of two lines. First line has the string $S$ of length $n$ (having 'a'-'z' , 'A'-'Z')  and second line has $M$ (rotation performed by Swati) and $P$ (rotation performed by Neha). \n\n###Output:\nFor each test case , if the original string $S$ is back by Swati then print \"SWATI\" or if the original string $S$ is back by Neha then print \"NEHA\". If its impossible to get back to the original string by performing the rotations as mentioned above, print -1.\n\n###Constraints \n- $1 \\leq T \\leq 50$\n- $1 \\leq n \\leq 500000$\n- $1 \\leq M,P \\leq n$\n\n\n###Sample Input:\n        2\n        AbcDef\n        1 2\n        abcabc\n        1 1\n\n###Sample Output:\n\tNeha\n Swati\n\t\n###EXPLANATION:\n$Case 1:\nSwati : fAbcDe , Neha : DefAbc, Swati : cDefAb , Neha : AbcDef.$\n\n$Case 2:\nSwati : cabcab ,Neha : bcabca, Swati : abcabc.$\n\n",
