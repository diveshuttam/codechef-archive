Several new international venues and players are going to play in this year\u2019s edition.

It's your turn to help Little Chef. </p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>First line contains 2 space separated integers N and M where N is the total number of players. Each player is labeled uniquely from 1 to N. M lines follow. Each line contains 2 space separated integers X and Y signifying that the player X is willing to play with player Y.</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>Output should consist of 2 lines. First line should contain the number of members in the team that the Chef should choose. The second line should contain a space separated list of all the players in Chef\u2019s team in increasing order. If no such team exist then print \u201c-1\u201d in a single line.
