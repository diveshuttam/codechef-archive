    "body": "<span class=\"solution-visible-txt\">All submissions for this problem are available.</span><p>Chef recently discovered a game called \"Table Tilt\".<br />\nThe game consists of a rectangular table which has several holes in it, and several balls placed on the table.<br />\nThe goal is to tilt the table so that the balls will roll into the holes.<br />\nThe edges of the table are blocked so that a ball cannot fall off the edge of a table.<br />\nBy careful tilting of the table, Chef is able to precisely control the movement of the balls.<br />\nChef controls the tilting so that each second, each ball will simultaneously attempt to<br />\nroll 1 unit in the same direction parallel to an edge of the table.<br />\nA ball will fail to move if doing so would cause it to fall off the table,<br />\nor if doing so would result in 2 balls in the same location after the move.</p>\n<p>There are different types of balls, and they have different effects when they roll into a hole.<br />\nThe ball types, along with their shorthand notations, and effects, are as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Neutral (=): no effect</li>\n<li>Positive (+): score increases by 5</li>\n<li>Negative (-): score decreases by 5</li>\n<li>Inverter (%): all positive balls become negative, and vice versa</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Additionally, the score decreases by 1 every second until all of the balls have rolled into holes,<br />\nat which point the game ends.<br />\nNote that multiple balls may roll into holes simultaneously.<br />\nIn this case, inverter balls are processed last.<br />\nThat is, if a negative ball and an inverter ball simultaneously roll into holes, the score is decreased by 5 before the<br />\nremaining negative balls become positive.<br />\nAdditionally, inverter balls are processed one at a time,<br />\nso if 2 inverter balls simultaneously roll into holes there is no net effect.\n</p>\n<p>Since Chef has mastered his tilting skill, he now needs strategy to improve his score.<br />\nHe has tasked you with finding a sequence of tilts that gives a good score.<br />\nChef is in a good mood and is not demanding an optimal sequence of tilts,<br />\nbut merely requires you find one that yields a positive score<br />\n(of course, the higher the score, the more appreciative Chef will be).</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>Input begins with an integer T, the number of test cases.<br />\nEach test case begins with 2 integers H and W on a line, giving the height and width, respectively,<br />\nof the table.<br />\nH lines follow of W characters each, giving the initial layout of the table.<br />\nA '*' character indicates a hole.<br />\nAll other characters will be '=', '+', '-', or '%',<br />\nindicating neutral, positive, negative, and inverter balls, respectively.\n</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>For each test case, output a single line with a sequence of 'U', 'L', 'D', and 'R' characters,<br />\ncorresponding to tilts up, left, down, and right, respectively.<br />\nThis sequence of tilts must be one that completes the game with a positive score.</p>\n<h3>Scoring</h3>\n<p>Your total score is the sum of the scores for the individual test cases.<br />\nNote that if the score for any individual test case is non-positive, the submission will be judged \"Wrong Answer\".\n</p>\n<h3>Sample Input</h3>\n<pre><code>2\n3 3\n%+-\n=*+\n-=+\n3 4\n+==-\n--%*\n+%-*\n</code></pre><h3>Sample Output</h3>\n<pre>LDRDLRULR\nRDLRRRDR\n\n\n</pre><p>\nThe score for the first test case after each tilt is: 4, 8, 7, 6, 10, 9, 8, 2, 6.<br/><br />\nThe score for the second test case after each tilt is: -6, -2, -3, 1, 5, 14, 13, 12.<br/><br />\nThe total score is therefore 18.<br />\nNote that better scores may be possible, but the only requirement is that the score be positive.\n</br/></br/></p>\n<h3>Test Case Generation</h3>\n<p>\nFor each official input file, T is 5.<br />\nFor each test case, H and W are chosen randomly and uniformly between 8 and 20.<br />\nEach cell of the table is chosen with the following probabilities:\n<ul>\n<li>Hole: 2%</li>\n<li>Inverter ball: 2%</li>\n<li>Neutral ball: 32%</li>\n<li>Positive ball: 32%</li>\n<li>Negative ball: 32%</li>\n</ul>\n</p><p>Furthermore, it is guaranteed there will be at least one hole and one inverter ball.\n</p>\n",
