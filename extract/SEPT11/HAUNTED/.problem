The timer starts at 0.\nEach second, the following happens (in order):\n<ul>\n<li>If the timer is equal to the maximum time Chef is allowed\nto spend in the maze, he will faint from hunger.</li>\n<li>Chef may move to one of the adjacent cells of the maze (north, east, south, or west of his current\nposition), provided that cell is neither a wall nor occupied by a ghost.\nChef also has the option of standing still.\n</li>\n<li>All of the ghosts move to the next cell in their repsective patrol paths.\nIf any ghost moves into the cell now occupied by Chef, Chef will faint.</li>\n<li>The timer is incremented by 1.</li>\n<li>If Chef is now standing at the location of the exit, Chef successfully\nescapes the maze.</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n<p>\nGhost patrol paths will be given as a list of waypoints.\nEach waypoint will be in-line either horizontally or vertically with the next waypoint in the list,\nand the final waypoint will similarly be in-line with the first waypoint.\nGhosts will move from waypoint to waypoint, one square at a time, using the shortest possible path.\nOnce a ghost reaches its final waypoint, it will travel back to the first waypoint and repeat the cycle.\nFor example, if a patrol path were given as the waypoints:<br/>\n(2,3) (1,3) (1,0) (0,0) (0,1) (2,1)<br/>\nThen the ghost's complete path would be:<br/>\n(2,3) (1,3) (1,2) (1,1) (1,0) (0,0) (0,1) (1,1) (2,1) (2,2)<br/>\nAfter which the sequence would repeat.\n</p>\n<h3>Input:</h3>\n<p>\nInput will begin with T, the number of test cases.\nEach test case begins with 4 integers: M, N, C, and K,\nwhere M is the height of the maze, N is the width of the maze,\nC is the number of ghosts, and K is the number of seconds before Chef will faint from hunger.\nC lines follow, each describing the patrol path of a ghost.\nEach patrol path begins with an integer L, the number of waypoints in the path, followed by L pairs of integers giving the (x,y)\ncoordinates of a waypoint on the path, where (0,0) is the top-left corner and (N-1, M-1) is the bottom-right corner.\nFinally, M lines of N characters each describe the maze itself.  A '.' character indicates a passable square, and a\n'#' character indicates an impassable wall (although the ghosts may pass through walls).  A '@' character indicates\nthe starting position of Chef (it is guaranteed that no ghost will begin here), and a '$' character indicates the exit\nof the maze (there will be exactly one '@' character and one '$' character in each test case).\n</p>\n\n<h3>Output:</h3>\n<p>For each test case, if Chef can escape without fainting, print the minimum number of seconds it will take him to escape.\nOtherwise, print -1.</p>\n\n<h3>Constraints:</h3>\nT\u226410<br/>\n1\u2264M,N\u226430<br/>\n0\u2264C\u226430<br/>\n0\u2264K\u2264100000<br/>\n2\u2264L\u226410<br/>\n\n\n<h3>Sample Input:</h3>\n<pre><code>\n4\n10 10 0 200\n##.$......\n@#.######.\n.#...#..#.\n.###....#.\n....###.#.\n#.#.....#.\n....#.###.\n.####.#.#.\n.#....#...\n..........\n3 10 1 18\n2 1 1 7 1\n###.######\n@........$\n######.###\n5 5 2 13\n2 2 4 2 1\n3 4 2 3 2 2 2\n##@##\n##.##\n$..##\n#####\n#####\n2 2 1 1000\n2 1 1 1 0\n@$\n..\n</code></pre>\n\n<h3>Sample Output:</h3>\n<pre>\n22\n18\n-1\n-1\n</pre>\n",
