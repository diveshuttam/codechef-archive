These groups for exchanging dishes can have more than 3 members as well. But usually this sort of an exchange arrangement ends up in fight, as a number of people in the group do not get the dish they like and have to stick with the original dish they got.<br />\nThe restaurant owner got a little worried because of the amount of fighting that has been going on in his restaurant everyday.<br />\nSo, he need's some help to make a plan such that he got to know, in advance, that which group will fight. This will allow him to resolve<br />\nthe matter immediately. Hence preventing the other groups from getting distracted and disturbed. </p>\n<p>So Your task is to print 'yes' if it is possible to exchange dishes such that all become happy and if not possible then print 'no'.</p>\n<p>Note: No person like the original dish they have.</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The first line has two integers: N , the number of people, and D, the total number of<br />\ndishes they like.<BR /><br />\nThe D lines that follow have two integers, A and B, indicating that member A likes the dish that member B got. </p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>You should output YES if we can find a new dish for every person in the group and NO if that is<br />\n not possible.</p>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<p>2 &lt;= N &lt;= 10000<br />\n1 &lt;= D &lt;=20000<br />\n0 &lt;= A, B &lt; N </p>\n<h3>Sample Test cases</h3>\n<p><b>Input:</b><br />\n3 3<br />\n0 1<br />\n1 2<br />\n2 0<br />\n<b>Output:</b><br />\nYES</p>\n",
