You can perform 2 types of queries on the matrix. The two query types are as follows:<br />\n1. Query one is of the type -   1 x1 y1 x2 y2 k<br />\n  For this query you have to increment by k all the elements in the sub matrix that has its top left corner element row as x1 and column as y1 and the bottom right corner element row as x2 and column as y2.<br />\n2. Query two is of the type -   2 x1 y1 x2 y2<br />\n  For this query you have to print the sum of all the elements in the sub matrix that has its top left corner element row as x1 and column as y1 and the bottom right corner element row as x2 and column as y2<br />\nYour task is print the answer for the 2 type queries, whenever they occur.\n</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>1. The first line of input contains 2 space separated integers n and m.<br />\n2. Then n lines follow each containing m space separated integers. This is the (n x m) matrix as input. Let this matrix element be denoted by e.<br />\n3. The next line of input conatins a positive integer q, the number of queries.<br />\n4. Then q lines follow each containing a query of either type as described in the problem statement.</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>The number of lines in the output is equal to 2 type queries. Each line contains the answer for that particular 2 type query.</p>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<p>1 &lt;= N, M x1,y1,x2,y2&lt;= 500<br />\n1 &lt;= a[i][j], k &lt;= 100, let a[][] be the matrix (n x m)<br />\n1 &lt;= q &lt;= 100000</p>\n<h3>Sample Test cases</h3>\n<p><b>Input:</b><br />\n3 3<br />\n73 5 57<br />\n89 53 66<br />\n21 27 74<br />\n6<br />\n1 1 1 3 3 10<br />\n2 1 1 3 3<br />\n1 1 1 3 3 10<br />\n2 1 1 3 3<br />\n1 1 1 3 3 10<br />\n2 1 1 3 3<br />\n<b>Output:</b><br />\n555<br />\n645<br />\n735</p>\n",
