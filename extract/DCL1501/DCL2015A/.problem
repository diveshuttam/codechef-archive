The person being a mathematician, created an interesting scheme for the sale. <br /><BR /><br />\n The scheme as stated by chef\u2019s friend is as follows:<BR /><br />\n There are different types of items available for the sale. A person can buy a number of these items. From the items that will be purchased, the type of item which has the most frequency was found out and that particular frequency was recorded. <BR /><BR /><br />\nNow, if this recorded number is a prime number, then half of the items of the item type that has a prime number frequency will be given as free and if the recorded number is a composite number, then half of the items of the item type that has a composite frequency will be given as free.<BR /><BR /><br />\nYou need to help the chef\u2019s friend in finding the final bill generated after all the deductions according to the scheme as stated above.<BR /><br /> You need to do this for a number of test cases.<br />\nThe cost of each item is $1.<br />\nThe items are depicted with use of characters (a-z, A-Z ), i.e., the items of same type are depicted with the same character. For an odd number, say n the value of n/2 is the value obtained after passing n/2 through the greatest integer function. For example:  11/2 will be 5.\n</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The first line contains the number of test cases t, that is, the number of people who purchase from the garage sale.<Br /><br />\nThe first and the only line of each test case contains a string s, the items purchased (containing a-z, A-Z ) by a person.<br />\n.</p>\n<p><BR /></p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>The output for each test case contains an integer in a separate line denoting the total amount paid by the person after the deductions being made according to the garage sale. </p>\n<p><BR /></p>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<p>1&lt;= t&lt;= 100<br />\n1&lt;=|s|&lt;=10000</p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n3\nabcdefghig\naabbccddddef\nAabcdef\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n9\n10\n7\n\n<h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p><b>Example case 1.</b>\nThe frequency of 'g' is maximum, i.e., 2.\nThe frequency of only 'g' is prime so half of items of type 'g' will be free. So, 1 item will be free.</p>\n\n<p><b>Example case 2.</b>\nThe frequency of 'd' is maximum, i.e., 4, which is a composite number.\nThe frequency of only 'd' is composite so half of items of type 'd' will be free. So, 2 items will be free.</p>\n</pre>",
