The test case starts with a single line containing N ( 2&lt;= N &lt;= 1000 ). The next N lines contain two space separated values the physical appearance value p ( -1000&lt;= P &lt;= 1000 ) and the mental ability value m ( -1000 &lt;= m &lt;= 1000 ) for an inhabitant.Both p and m will be integers.\n</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>\nPrint a single line containing the minimum value of Similarity Quotient of the Android rounded to 2 decimal places.\n</p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n\n4\n-1 -1\n1 -1\n-1 1\n1 1\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n\n5.66\n</pre>",
