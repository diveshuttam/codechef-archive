He also had a list of positive non-zero integers $a_1, a_2, \\ldots ,a_N$. He was bored of his usual adventures and decided to build a new directed graph $G' = (U, F)$. $U$ = {$u_1, u_2, \\ldots, u_N$} and $(u_i, u_j) \\in F$ if and only if there is a walk of length exactly $a_i$ from $v_i$ to $v_j$ in $G$. Note that this walk could repeat edges. He then noticed that the new directed graph $G'$ had two vertices $u_i$ and $u_j$ , such that there was no path from $u_i$ to $u_j$ in $G'$. Note that there could be more such pairs of vertices.\n\nBut now, Maui has lost his list of integers, and has only the graph $G$. Help him by constructing any list which would satisfy the property mentioned, or state that it cannot be done.\n\n###Input:\n\n- The first line of the input contains two integers: $N, M$, which represent the number of nodes and edges in $G$ respectively.\n- The i-th of the next $M$ lines contains two numbers $i$ and $j$, which signify that the undirected edge $(v_i, v_j)$ exists in $G$.\n\n###Output:\n- If a list of integers which satisfies the property exists, print \"YES\" in the first line and the $N$ integers in order in the second line. Each of the integers must satisfy $1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$.\n- If it does not exist, print \"NO\".\n\n###Constraints \n- $2 \\leq N \\leq 100$\n- $1 \\leq M \\leq \\frac{N*(N-1)}{2}$\n- $1 \\leq i, j \\leq N$\n- The input graph will be connected.\n- There will be no multi-edges or self-loops.\n\n###Subtasks\n- 19 points : $2 \\leq N \\leq 15$\n- 5 points : The input graph will be bi-partite.\n- 76 points : No further constraints.\n\n###Sample Input:\n\t3 2\n\t1 2\n\t2 3\n\n###Sample Output:\n\tYES\n\t2 1 2\n\t\n###Explanation:\nIn our output, $a_1 = 2$, and so there will be a direct edge from $u_1$ to $u_2$ if and only if there is a walk of length 2 between $v_1$ and $v_2$. But there isn't any such walk. But there is a walk of length 2 between $v_1$ and $v_3$, and so there is a direct edge from $u_1$ to $u_3$ in $G'$. Similarly you can check that the edge set of $G'$ is {$(u_1, u_3), (u_3, u_1), (u_2, u_1), (u_2, u_3)$}. Now notice that there is no path from $u_1$ to $u_2$ in $G'$. Hence this is a valid output.",
