We want to make these two arrays identical. That is, for each $1 \\leq i \\leq N$, we want to make $A_i$ = $B_i$. To do this, we are allowed to make many operations of the following type:\n\nIn a single operation, we choose two integers $x$ and $y$, and replace all the occurrences of $x$ in both the arrays with $y$. This operation is denoted by $(x, y)$. Notice that regardless of the number of characters replaced, it will still be counted as a single operation.\n\nA sequence of operations $((x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), \\ldots, (x_m, y_m))$ is said to be optimal, if after performing these operations in the given order, both arrays $A$ and $B$ are identical, and there is no sequence with fewer operations which can achieve the same.\n\nYou will also be given an integer $K$ which will either be $1$ or $2$. If $K = 1$, you need to output the minimum number of operations needed to make the two arrays identical. If $K = 2$, in addition to the minimum number of operations, you should also output the number of different optimal sequences. As this number could be huge, output it modulo $10^9 + 7$.\n\n###Input:\n\n- The first line of the input contains a single integer, $T$, which is the number of testcases. The description of each testcase follows.\n- The first line of each testcase contains two integers: $N$, and $K$.\n- The next line contains $N$ integers: $A_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_N$.\n- The next line contains $N$ integers: $B_1, B_2, \\ldots, B_N$.\n\n###Output:\n- You need to output a single line for each testcase.\n- If $K = 1$, then that corresponding line should contain a single integer, which is the minimum number of operations needed.\n- If $K = 2$, then that corresponding line should contain two integers, the minimum number of operations needed and the number of optimal sequences modulo $10^9 + 7$.\n\n###Constraints \n- $1 \\leq T \\leq 5$\n- $1 \\leq N \\leq 10^5$\n- $1 \\leq K \\leq 2$\n- $1 \\leq A_i, B_i \\leq N$\n\n###Subtasks\n- 16 points : $K = 1$\n- 84 points : No further constraints.\n\n###Sample Input:\n\t2\n\t5 1\n\t2 1 1 3 5\n\t1 2 2 4 5\n\t5 2\n\t2 1 1 3 5\n\t1 2 2 4 5\n\t\n###Sample Output:\n\t2\n\t2 8\n\t\n###Explanation:\nTestcase 1: The arrays are initially $(2, 1, 1, 3, 5)$ and $(1, 2, 2, 4, 5)$. Consider the sequence of operations $((1, 2), (3, 4))$. In the first operation all the $1$s are converted into $2$s. So, the arrays will now be $(2, 2, 2, 3, 5)$ and $(2, 2, 2, 4, 5)$. In the second operation all the $3$s are converted into $4$s. So, the arrays will now be $(2, 2, 2, 4, 5)$ and $(2, 2, 2, 4, 5)$. We have made the two arrays identical in two operations, and you can check that you cannot do better. Hence the output is $2$.\n\nTestcase 2: The arrays are the same, and hence the first integer is the same. Now we need to also find the number of optimal sequences. They are listed below:\n\n- $((1, 2), (3, 4))$\n- $((1, 2), (4, 3))$\n- $((2, 1), (3, 4))$\n- $((2, 1), (4, 3))$\n- $((3, 4), (1, 2))$\n- $((3, 4), (2, 1))$\n- $((4, 3), (1, 2))$\n- $((4, 3), (2, 1))$\n\nSince there are eight optimal sequences, the second integer is $8$.",
