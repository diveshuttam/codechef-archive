One day while coming back to his tent he lost his way.<br/>\nWhile searching for the way back he encountered THREE SUPERNATURAL RIVERS,out of which only one can take him back to his tent.<br/>\nEach river has rocks besides it with numbers on it starting from 1,3 and 9 respectively.<br/>\nThe next rock in the series has number as the previous number plus the sum of digits of previous number.<br/>\neg for river with rock no. 1 as first rock the series will be: 1,1+1=2,2+2=4,4+4=8,8+8=16,16+1+6=23,23+2+3=28,... or 1,2,4,8,16,23,28,38,49.....<br/>\nor for river with rock no 3 as first rock:<br/> 3,3+3=6,6+6=12,12+1+2=15,15+1+5=21,21+2+1=24,24+2+4=30.... or 3,6,12,15,21,24,30,33,39,51...<br/>\nor the series for 29 will be: <br/>29,29+2+9=40,40+4+0=44,44+4+4=52,52+5+2=59,59+5+9=73..... or 29,40,44,52,59,73.....<br/>\n<br/>\nChef also has a number in his mind. This number will help him to determine that which river he has to cross and from which rock.<br/>\nHe has to cross at the roch number of the specific river where both the series of river and the series of the number he has thought have a number in common.<br/>\neg. if has thought of the number 29, then he would have to cross river 1 at rock number 107.<br/>\nExplanation: series of 1: <br/>1,2,4,8,16,23,28,38,49,62,70,77,91,101,103,107,....\n                   <br/>series of 29: 29,40,44,52,73,83,94,107,....<br/>\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>T, T= number of inputs (1<=T<=100)<br/>\n      then T lines with N,  N= number Chef has thought (1<=N<=1000000)\n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>The river he has to cross (i.e 1 or 3 or 9) and the rock number on that river where he has to cross\n\n<h3>Example</h3>\n\n<pre>\n<b>Input:</b>\n2\n29\n42\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n1 107\n3 111\n\n</pre>\n",
