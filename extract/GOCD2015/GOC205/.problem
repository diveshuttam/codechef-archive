The athletes are lined up in a row from 1 to <b>N</b>, and each one having a chest number, <b>Ai</b> equal to their height. Coach Jamalta is very keen about knowing the order in which the athletes are standing and he has the power to remove anyone he wants from that line. Before the race starts he will give <b>Q</b> commands to the best sportsperson Prakash Chaudhary and Prakash has to obey him. The commands can be either of the following:<br />\n<br /><br />\n1. Replace the <b>ith</b> athlete in the line with a new athlete of height <b>X</b>. This will be represented in the input as a line containing the number 1 followed by the space-separated numbers <b>i</b> and <b>X</b>.<br />\n<br /><br />\n2. Count how many athletes in the range <b>[P, Q]</b> have <b>Ai</b> height &lt;=<b>X</b>. This will be represented in the input as a line containing the number 2 followed by the space-separated numbers <b>P, Q  and X</b>.<br />\n<br /><br />\nOf course, no one can beat Prakash in any sports, but he is not so good in studies and would definitely need your help.</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The first line gives the integers <b>N</b> and <b>Q</b>, and the next <b>N</b> lines give the initial values of <b>Ai</b>. Finally the next <b>Q</b> lines each contain a query of the form  <b>1 i X</b> or <b>2 P Q X</b>.</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>Print the answer to each 2 query, one per line.</p>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<p>1 \u2264 <b>Ai</b> \u2264 1,000,000,000<br />\n<br /><br />\n1 \u2264 <b>X</b> \u2264 1,000,000,000<br />\n<br /><br />\n1 \u2264 <b>N</b> \u2264 1,00,000<br />\n<br /><br />\n<b>1 \u2264 P \u2264 Q \u2264 N</b>\n</p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n4 6\n3\n4\n1\n7\n2 2 4 4\n1 4 1\n2 2 4 4\n2 1 4 5\n1 2 10\n2 1 3 9\n\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n2\n3\n4\n2\n</pre><h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p>There are 4 athletes, whose initial numbers are 3, 4, 1, and 7. Jamalta sir then gave Prakash 6 commands; the first asks him to count the how many of the last three athletes have height at most 4, the second asks him to replace the fourth athlete with the one having height 1 unit, etc.\t</p>\n",
