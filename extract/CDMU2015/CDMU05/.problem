However being a programmer, she has noticed few things.<br />\n<br />\nThe examination hall is a 2-D grid with M rows and N seats in each row. However students in say ,row 1 are the most mischievous<br />\nand copy the most,But they don't copy from students of other rows as they are afraid of being caught. The N students seated in row<br />\n1 are numbered from 1 to N. <br />\nAlso a student in a single row of N seats can only copy from a student sitting either just ahead of him or just behind him .For 1st<br />\nand last student in the row, they can only copy only from 2nd and 2nd to last student respectively.<br />\n</p>\n<p>\nNow the supervisor gets bored and starts thinking about how many ways can we select a non-empty subset of those N students in 1st row<br />\nsuch that :<br />\nFor each of those selected subsets: <b><br />\n(a)There are no two students who can copy from each other. <br />\n(b)Addition of any of the remaining students in this subset results in copying.</b><br />\nNote : Remaining students for a subset means students from 1 to N who are not present in this subset</p>\n<p>As answers can be large, print it modulo 1000000007(1e9+7).\n</p>\n<p>\n<h3>Sample Explanation :</h3>\n</p>\n<p>\nFor N=5,there are 4 valid subsets = ({1,4},{2,4},{1,3,5},{2,5})<br />\n</p>\n<p>\nSubset {2,5} is valid subset because : <br />\n1) Student 2 and student 5 can't copy. So it satisfies property (a) <br />\n2) if we add student 1, then student 1 and student 2 will copy <br />\n    if we add student 3, then student 2 and student 3 will copy  <br />\n    if we add student 4, then student 4 and student 5 will copy  <br />\n   Hence we cant add any of remaining students to this subset.So it satisfies property (b)<br />\nSimilarly {1,4} , {2,4} , {1,3,5} are valid subsets.\n</p>\n<p>\nSubset {1,5} is not valid because :<br />\n   if we add student 3 in this subset ,still no one can copy.Hence,it doesn't satisfy property (b).<br />\nSubset {1,2,5} is not valid because :<br />\n   Student 1 and student 2 can copy. Hence,it doesn't satisfy property (a).<br />\nSimilarly the remaining 25 subsets for N=5 are invalid.\n</p>\n<p>Thus ,for N=5 , valid subsets(output) = 4\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p> First line will be number of test cases T.<br />\nEach test case will have a single number N.\n</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>Number of subsets which satisfy both property (a) and (b) in a single line for each test case</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<p>1&lt;=T&lt;=10^5 <br />\n1&lt;=N&lt;=10^6 </p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>\n4\n1\n2\n5\n30\n</b>\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n1\n2\n4\n4410\n</pre><p>\u00a0</p>\n",
