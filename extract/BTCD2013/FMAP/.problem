Currently the Headquarter of company is situated at index hq1. Each pair of connected cities are connected both ways. The connection is such that there is exactly one connection from the Headquarter to each city. The map of the connected cities is kept in the following way: for each city i, different from the Headquarter, there is kept number ci \u2014 index of the last city on the way from the Headquarter to i.<br />\n<br /><br />\nThe company decided to move the Headquarter from city hq1 to city hq2. So, after this change the old representation of the map as described above became incorrect. Please, help the company to find out a new map in the way described above.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The first line contains the number of test cases(0 &lt; T &lt;= 10 ).
