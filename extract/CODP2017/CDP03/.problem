He has bought a plot of width w and height h. Chef's numerologist Alice is not happy with the dimensions of his plot. A plot is said to be nice if its width:height is exactly x:y.</p>\n\n<p>Chef wants to transform his plot into a 'nice' plot because he cannot take a risk with his new Coaching classes. He already has invested a lot of money so he will not buy new plot any more. Thus, he need to resize the plot such that it becomes nice and its area is maximum.</p>\n\n<p>Help Chef in resizing the plot.</p>\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>A single integer T denoting the no of test cases. Next T lines contain 4 space separated integers w,h,x,y.</p>\n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>For each test case print 2 space separated integers denoting the width and height of the maximum nice plot. In case no answer exists output 0 0 </p>\n\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul><li>1 <= T <= 40</li>\n<li>1 <= w,h,x,y <= 10<sup>9</sup></li></ul>\n\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n2\n6 5 3 2\n6 4 27 31\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n6 4\n0 0\n</pre>",
