At CodeChef, we work hard to revive the geek in you by hosting a programming contest at the start of the month and another smaller programming challenge in the middle of the month.</p> </div> <p><br style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\" /><b class=\"rules-heading\">About CodeChef October Cook-Off:</b></p> <div class=\"rules-body\"> <p><font color=\"#444444\" face=\"Arial, sans-serif\"><span>CodeChef Cook-Off is a two and half hour coding contest where you can show off your computer programming skills. We believe October Mega Cook-Off will serve as a practice for ACM ICPC 2015-16. Also, as a part of Directi's GoforGold initiative, top 75 Indian students in the contest will be provided with a reimbursement (for travel, registration etc) of upto INR 1500 for ACM-ICPC regionals.</span></font></p> </div> <p><br style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\" /><b class=\"rules-heading\">Contest Details:</b></p> <div class=\"rules-body\"> <ul class=\"\"> <li><b>Duration: </b>2.5 hrs</li> <li><b>Start Date: </b>Sunday, 18th October, 2015 at 21:30 HRS (IST)</li> <li><b>End Date: </b>Monday, 19th October, 2015 at 00:00 HRS (IST).</li> <li>Check your time zone\u00a0<span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=CodeChef%3A+October+Cook-Off+2015&amp;iso=20151018T2130&amp;p1=44&amp;ah=2&amp;am=30\">here</a></span><span>.</span></li> <li><b>Number of problems: </b>5</li> </ul> </div> <p><b class=\"rules-heading\">Eligibility Criteria: Anyone with a knack for Programming :P</b></p> <div class=\"rules-body\"> <p>Our contests are open to all the programmers across the globe.</p> </div> <p><br style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\" /><b class=\"rules-heading\">What is it for you?</b></p> <div class=\"rules-body\"> <p>The idea behind these programming contests is that we want you to learn while competing. Also we believe that it is alright to refer to tutorials, books and other materials, learn a concept and then apply the same to solve a problem during a contest. But it is\u00a0<b>not alright to copy other people's solutions or seek other people's help to solve a problem without understanding it.</b> The dividing line may seem to be thin but it can be captured by the spirit of learning. If whatever you are doing is making you learn while you do so, we tend to believe that it is alright. However, all the participants are expected to abide to\u00a0<a href=\"http://discuss.codechef.com/questions/18662/does-codechef-have-any-code-of-conduct\" target=\"_blank\">CodeChef Code Of Conduct</a>.</p> <p>Not just that, as a token of motivation we also give away cash prizes and goodies to the winners of the contest. However, our sole intention lies in making our users learn new concepts while competing.</p> </div> <p><br style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\" /><b class=\"rules-heading\">What's new in CodeChef?</b></p> <div class=\"rules-body\"> <p>We've recently launched our\u00a0<a href=\"/ide\" target=\"_blank\">IDE</a> and you may now Code, Compile and Run on our online ide.

Ties will be broken by the total time for each user in ascending order of time.</li> <li>The total time is the sum of the time consumed for each problem solved. The time consumed for a solved problem is the time elapsed from the beginning of the contest to the submittal of the first accepted run plus 20 penalty minutes for every previously rejected run for that problem. There is no time consumed for a problem that is not solved.</li> <li>You shall not possess more than one account on CodeChef.
