Between each pair of cities there is <b>exactly 1 road</b>, and you are allowed to travel on it in only one direction. Lukas has decided to buy a car from one of these cities in such a way that it is possible to start from that city and reach any other city by travelling in his car.\n</p>\n<p>\nA very important factor in buying a car is the range of that car. The range of a car is the maximum distance you can travel in it. If you buy a car with range <b>d</b> in some city <b>c</b>, then you can visit only those cities such that there is a path from <b>c</b> to that city of length \u2264 <b>d</b>.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn order to save money Lukas wants to buy a car with the minimum possible range. So now, given the map of roads between cities please tell Lukas the minimum range car he can buy and also tell him the city he should buy it from, so that it is possible to reach every other city from that city in that car.\n</p>\n<p>\nIf for a given minimum range, there exist multiple cities you can buy that car from, you may print any of them. If there is no city such that you can reach every other city from there, print -1.\n</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The first line of the input contains an integer <b>T</b> denoting the number of test cases. The description of <b>T</b> test cases follows.\n</p>\n<p>The first line of each test case contains a single integer <b>N</b> denoting the number of cities. The next <b>N</b> lines each contain <b>N</b> space-separated integers. All of these integers are either <b>0</b> or <b>1</b>.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe ith line contains <b>A<sub>i1</sub></b>, <b>A<sub>i2</sub></b>, ..., <b>A<sub>iN</sub></b>. If <b>A<sub>ij</sub></b> is <b>1</b> then the road between city <b>i</b> and <b>j</b> goes from <b>i</b> to <b>j</b> and if <b>A<sub>ij</sub></b> is <b>0</b> then the road between city <b>i</b> and <b>j</b> goes from <b>j</b> to <b>i</b>.\n</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>For each test case, output a single line containing 2 space-separated integers. The first integer denotes the range of the car and the second denotes the city where you should buy the car. If there is more than 1 correct answer, you may choose any of them.\n</p>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>T,N</b> \u2264 <b>2000</b></li>\n<li><b>A<sub>ij</sub></b> = <b>0</b> or <b>1</b> for all <b>i,j</b></li>\n<li><b>A<sub>ij</sub></b> = <b>0</b> if <b>i</b> = <b>j</b>, otherwise <b>A<sub>ij</sub></b> + <b>A<sub>ji</sub></b> = 1</li>\n<li> Sum of <b>N</b> over all test cases will be \u2264 2000.</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n2\n3\n0 1 1\n0 0 0\n0 1 0\n3\n0 1 0\n0 0 1\n1 0 0\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n1 1\n2 2\n\n</pre><h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p><b>Example case 1.</b> If you buy a car in city 1, then the minimum range you need is 1. For all the other cities you cant do better than this.</p>\n<p><b>Example case 2.</b> No matter where you buy a car, you will need it to have a range of 2.</p>\n",
