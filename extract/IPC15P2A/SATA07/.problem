There are a total of <b>N</b> items for sale. Each item costs 1 gold coin and has a certain value and a certain weight.\n</p>\n<p>\nLukas has <b>M</b> gold coins and decided to spend them all on magical items. This means he will buy exactly <b>M</b> out of the <b>N</b> items. Naturally, Lukas wants to maximize the sum of the values of the items he buys. At the same time he wants to minimize the sum of weights of the items he buys. Finally, he decides he wants to maximize the ratio:<br />\n<br /><br />\n<center><b>Sum of values of items he buys/Sum of weights of items he buys</b></center><br />\n<br />\n</p>\n<p>\nHowever now Lukas is confused what is the maximum ratio he can get, so he asks you to help him out. Also, Lukas doesn't mind if the absolute difference between your answer and the actual answer is less than 10<sup>-6</sup>\n</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The first line of the input contains an integer <b>T</b> denoting the number of test cases. The description of <b>T</b> test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains 2 integers <b>N</b> and <b>M</b> denoting the number of items on sale and the number of items he has to buy.<br />\n<br /><br /><br />\nThe next <b>N</b> lines each contain 2 space-separated integers. The <b>i</b>th line contains <b>Value<sub>i</sub></b>, <b>Weight<sub>i</sub></b> denoting the value and the weight of the <b>i</b>th item.\n</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>For each test case, output a single line containing the maximum value of <b>Sum of values/Sum of weights</b> that Lukas can achieve if he buys exactly <b>M</b> items.\n</p>\n<p>Your output will be considered correct if the absolute difference between your output and the correct one is less than 10<sup>-6</sup>\n</p>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<p><ul>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>T,Value<sub>i</sub>,Weight<sub>i</sub></b> \u2264 <b>100000</b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>M</b> \u2264 <b>N</b> \u2264 <b>100000</b></li>\n<li> Sum of <b>N</b> over all test cases is \u2264 <b>100000</b>\n</li></ul>\n</p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n2\n3 2\n5 1\n4 3\n10 2\n2 2\n3 5\n5 3\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n5.00000000\n1.00000000\n\n</pre><h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p><b>Example case 1:</b> Lukas can buy item 1 and 3 to get a total value of 15 and a total weight of 3. This gets him to a ratio of 5. Buying item 1 and 2 gets him to a ratio of 2.25, and buying items 2 and 3 gets him to a ratio of 2.8. Clearly the best ratio he can get is 5.</p>\n<p><b>Example case 2:</b> Lukas has to buy all the items in this case so he doesn't have any choice. This gets him a total value of 8 and a total value of 8, which means a ratio of 1.</p>\n",
