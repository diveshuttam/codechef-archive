He has decided to go an ATM and withdraw all <b>L</b> dollars from his account as he wants to buy a gift for his girlfriend.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe ATM machine gives Lukas a list of  <b>n</b> denominations in which he can withdraw money. Lukas has decided to withdraw <b>atleast 1</b> currency note of each of the <b>n</b> denominations. Lukas is not sure about the exact price of the gift which he will buy for his girlfriend so he wants to make sure that he withdraws his money in such a way that he can form all integer amounts of money from <b>1</b> to <b>L</b> dollars using the currency notes he has. He also wants to make sure that there is a <b>unique</b> way in which he can form the price of the good using his currency notes. Two ways to form a number are considered different if the number of notes of any denomination is different in the two ways.Help Lukas determine whether he can actually do so.<br />\n\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>\nThe first line of input will contain a single integer <b>T</b> denoting the number of test-cases.<br />\n<br />Each test cases consists of 2 lines.:<br />\n<br /> The first line of each test case will contain 2  space separated  integers <b>n</b> and  <b>L</b> where <b>n</b> denotes the number of denominations in the ATM machine and <b>L</b> is the amount of money Lukas has in his bank account.<br />\n<br /> The second line of each test case will contain <b>n</b> distinct space separated integers where the ith integer denotes the value of the ith denomination.<br />\n\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>\nFor each testcase output  <b>-1</b> if Lukas cannot satisfy the conditions mentioned above , otherwise output a list of <b>n</b> space separated integers where the first number is the number of notes of the first denomination in the input that Lukas will withdraw,the second number is the number of notes of the second denomination in the input that Lukas will withdraw and so on.<br />\n\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<p>\n<b><br />\n <br /> 1 &lt;= T = 30<br />\n <br /> 1 &lt;=L &lt;= 10<sup>18</sup><br />\n <br /> 1 &lt;=n &lt;= 10<sup>5</sup><br />\n <br /> 1 &lt;= Value of each denomination &lt;= 10<sup>12</sup><br />\n <br /> All denominations will be distinct.<br />\n</b>\u00a0\n</p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n2\n2 5\n1 2\n3 6\n1 2 3  \n<b>Output:</b>\n1 2\n-1\n</pre><h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p>In the first testcase  , you can have 1 currency note of denomination 1 and 2 currency notes of value 2. All numbers from 1 to 5 can be formed uniquely using these notes.<br />\n<br />In the second testcase, as we have to choose atleast one of all three denominations, we choose 1 currency note each of denomination 1,2 and 3. But then we cannot form 3 in a unique way as 3=1+2.\n</p>\n",
