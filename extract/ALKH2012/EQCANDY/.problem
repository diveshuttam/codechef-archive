Chef wants to have same number of candies in each box but he can only transfer candies to the next (i+1) th box only. He can remove any number of candies from the last box and throw them out. He wants to put maximum number candies in each box. Since you are really good at mathematics, so he has asked you to find the maximum number of candies <b>K</b> that he can put in each box.\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>First line of input contains a single integer <b>T</b>, number of test cases. Description of each test contains 2 lines. First line contains single integer <b>N</b>, number of boxes. Next line contains <b>N</b> integers. i th number denoting <b>C[i]</b>, the number of candies in each box .\n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>For each test case output the maximum number of candies each box will contain after transferring candies, <b>K</b>. \n<pre>\n\n\n<b>Constraints:</b>\n\n1<=<b>T</b><=100\n1<= <b>N</b><=10^4\n1<=<b>C[i]</b><=10^9\n</pre>\n\n<h3>Example</h3>\n\n<pre>\n<b>Input:</b>\n3\n3\n3 2 1\n4\n1 2 3 4\n3\n3 1 2\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n2\n1\n2\n\n<b>Explanation:</b>\n<pre>\nFor first test case, he can transfer 1 candy to next box that makes configuration as 2 3 1. \nThen he can transfer 1 candy from 2nd box to 3rd , thus <b>K</b>=2.\n</pre>\n</pre>\n",
