Crazy bob decided to fix it in a crazy way. The n transformers are of 2 types. The first  kind can be fixed in a single attempt with probability A% and the second kind can be fixed in a single attempt with probability B%. You are given a string composed of characters 'A' and 'B' to denote which type of transformers each one is.\n\nAs always, Bob wants to show off his transformer fixing skills in a crazy way. While atleast one of the transformer is mal-functioning, he randomly chooses a set of k transformers and attempts to fix all of them. The transformers that are already working (in the set of chosen k) remain working. Of the chosen transformers that are still mal-functioning, the transformers that are of type A get fixed with probability A% and the transformers of type B get fixed with probability B%.  You are asked to find the expected number of steps Bob takes to fix all the transformers. One step is a selection of k random transformers from n.\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>\nThe first line of the input consists of the number of testcases T (T<=200).\nEach of the test case starts with 4 integers n, k, A, B which denote the number of transformers to be repaired, the number k crazy-bob chooses at each iteration. A and B are the probabilities in percent. \nConstraints:\n1<=n<=40, \n1<=k<=n, \n1<=A<=99, \n1<=B<=99, \n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>\nOutput one number for each line - the expected number of iterations crazy-bob needs to perform before all the transformers are repaired. Your answer will be considered correct if the absolute difference between your number and the correct number is <10^(-6)\n\n<h3>Example</h3>\n\n<pre>\n<b>Input:</b>\n4\n2 1 99 99\nAA\n1 1 99 99\nA\n2 1 40 60\nAB\n2 1 100 100\nAA\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n3.0303030303\n1.0101010101\n6.3333333333\n3.0000000000\n\n<b>Explanation:</b>\n<p>\nIn the third test case, Bob randomly chooses one of the \ntransformers (with 1/2 probability each) and fixes them. \nThus he is left with fixing 1 transformer. Let x be the \nexpected number of moves before he can fix the 1 \ntransformer.\nSo the answer is 1+x.\nTo calculate x, at the next step, he  randomly chooses any\n of the transformers (with 1/2 each). If he chooses the fixed\n transformer, he has wasted the move and is back to x. If \nhe chooses the faulty one, he has fixed both the \ntransformers. Hence x = 1+1/2(x) or x = 2.\nThe required answer is 1+x = 3.\n",
