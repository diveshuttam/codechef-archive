The last line of each test case contains an integer <b>P</b> which is basically a prime number.\n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>\nFor each test case output the area of the coolest region required for Little Johny for his survival.If there are more than one possible coolest regions, then print the one which has maximum area.\n\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<pre>\n1<=<b>T</b><=10\n1<=<b>N,M</b><=100\n2<=<b>P</b><=10^4 and <b>P</b> is a prime number\n</pre>\n\n<h3>Example</h3>\n\n<pre>\n<b>Input:</b>\n2\n2 2\nFI\nFI\n2\n3 4\nFIFI\nIIIF\nIIFF\n23  \n<b>Output:</b>\n2\n6\n</pre>\n",
