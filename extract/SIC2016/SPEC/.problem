Here MxN is the dimension of the city grid. (X,Y) is location of Zoom.</br>\n\nThis is followed by M lines. Each line consist of N space separated positive integers corresponding to tower heights. D is the maximum difference between heights of tower that Flash can cross.</br>\n</br>\n<b>Output</b>\n</br>\nOne line for each test case containing a single integer, denoting the minimum number of towers Flash needs to cross. Return -1 if its not not possible.\n</br>\n</br>\n<b>Constraints</b></br>\n1 <= T<=60</br>\n1<= M, N, X, Y <= 100</br>\n1 <= D <= 10<sup>5</sup></br>\nEach building height will be less than 10<sup>5</sup></br>\n</br>\n<b>Sample Input Output</b></br>\n</br>\n<b>Input:</b>\n</br>\n2</br>\n3 3 3 3 2</br>\n1 2 3</br>\n6 9 4</br>\n7 8 5</br>\n3 3 3 3 1</br>\n1 8 3</br>\n9 5 6</br>\n7 2 4</br>\n</br>\n<b>Output:</b></br>\n3</br>\n-1</br>",
