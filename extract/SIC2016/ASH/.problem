Now he is so obsessed with pikachu that he wants to increase its <b>CP (Combat Power)</b> using pikachu candies. He caught the pikachu with CP <b>'X'</b> and can increase its CP to maximum <b>'Y'</b>. <br><br>Now Ash loves maths so he wants to increase pikachu's CP in such a way that after every increase we get CP value which has exactly <b>'K'</b> unique prime factors. If every increase in CP is considered as a step, then what is the <b>maximum number of steps</b> in which he can attain its maximum CP value possible(* which also has exactly <b>'K' prime factors</b>). If it is not possible to increase its CP value then print <b>'-1'</b>.\n<br><br>\n<b>Input:</b><br>\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.<br>\nThe first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers <b>X, Y and K</b>. <br>\n<br>\n1 < T < 10<sup>5</sup><br>\n1 \u2264 X \u2264 Y \u2264 10<sup>6</sup><br>\n0 \u2264 K \u2264 10<br>\n<br>\n<b>Output:</b><br>\nFor each test case, output the maximum number of steps.<br>\n<br>\n<b>Sample:</b><br>\n<br>\n<b>Input:</b><br>\n3<br>\n3 5 1<br>\n3 6 2<br>\n3 10 3<br>\n<br>\n<b>Output:</b><br>\n2<br>\n1<br>\n-1<br>\n",
