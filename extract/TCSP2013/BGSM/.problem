To disprove this,<br />\nyou want to analyze a collection of elephants and place as large a subset of elephants<br />\nas possible into a sequence whose weights are increasing but IQ\u2019s are decreasing.</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The input will consist of data for a bunch of elephants, at one elephant per line terminated<br />\nby the end-of-file. The data for each particular elephant will consist of a pair of<br />\nintegers: the first representing its size in kilograms and the second representing its IQ<br />\nin hundredths of IQ points. Both integers are between 1 and 10,000. The data contains<br />\ninformation on at most 1,000 elephants. Two elephants may have the same weight, the<br />\nsame IQ, or even the same weight and IQ.</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>The only output line should contain an integer n, the length of elephant sequence<br />\nfound.. If these sequence<br />\nof n elephants are a[1], a[2],..., a[n] then it must be the case that weight's of 1,2,3...n must be in strictly increasing order and iq's of 1,2,3,..n must be in strictly decreasing order.<br />\nIn order for the answer to be correct, n must be as large as possible. All inequalities<br />\nare strict: weights must be strictly increasing, and IQs must be strictly decreasing.</p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre>\n<b>Input:</b>\n6008 1300\n6000 2100\n500 2000\n1000 4000\n1100 3000\n6000 2000\n8000 1400\n6000 1200\n2000 1900\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n4\n</pre>",
