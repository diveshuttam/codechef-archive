    "body": "<span class=\"solution-visible-txt\">All submissions for this problem are available.</span><p>Tom is fond of permutations. He tricks every one by his strange problems. Here is one of them.<br />\nOnce he gave Jerry an infinite supply of positive (natural) numbers .<br />\nThen he challenged him if he could pick up certain set of numbers such that their sum is equal to a particular number N.<br />\nJerry being brilliant quickly found a solution. This deeply hurt the ego of Tom. </p>\n<p>Now Tom was furious and asked Jerry if he could tell him the count of all possible solutions to this problem.<br />\nHe also added one more constraint that is Jerry must pick exactly K numbers to form the required set.<br />\nTwo sets of K-tuples (n1,n2,.....,nK) , (a1,a2,.....,ak) are considered different if for <i> atleast one i => ni != ai </i>. <br />\nFor example for N=5 and K=2 (2,3) and (1,4) are distinct also (1,4) and (4,1) are distinct. Hence a total of 4 such sets could be formed.</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The first line contains one integer T, the number of test cases.<br />\nNext T lines contains two space separated integers N, K.<br />\nN= The sum that is required to be produced<br />\nK= The number of positive integers in a set that sum upto N </p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>Output a single line corresponding to each test case the count of number of solution possible.<br />\nOutput -1 if no solution exists.<br />\nSince the answer can be large so take MOD with 10^9 + 7.</p>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b>0</b> &lt; <b>T</b> \u2264 <b>100000</b></li>\n<li><b>0</b> &lt; <b>N</b> \u2264 <b>10000</b></li>\n<li><b>0</b> &lt; <b>K</b> \u2264 <b>10000</b></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre>Sample Input\n4\n5 4\n4 9\n9 2\n4 1\n\nSample Output\n4\n-1\n8\n1\n</pre>",
