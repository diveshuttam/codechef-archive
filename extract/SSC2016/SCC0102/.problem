    "body": "<span class=\"solution-visible-txt\">All submissions for this problem are available.</span><p>\nSteve was sitting at a railway terminal and gazing at the digital display board. The board was displaying a scrolling message(a long one) moving from right to left.The same message kept scrolling over and over again just like in the news telecasts. Steve gazed at the message for some time and he felt that he<br />\ncould memorize the whole message efficiently by memorizing only a small text, i.e. though the whole message was too big to memorize, a small \"part\" could be repeated a number of times to fetch the real message. You have to help him find out the length of this small part. For example, if the message is \"abcabcab\", the repetition could be \"abcabc\" or \"abc\" or \"bca\" or \"cab\" or \"bcabca\", then the smallest repetition's length is 3 as in \"abc\" or \"bca\".<br />\nAssume a string S is of length L. A string s1 (of length l. l&lt;=L) is said to be repitition of string S if s1 is written down infinitely many times in a row without any spaces, has string S as a substring of this new string.</p>\n<p>In the above example:<br />\nS = \"abcabcab\"<br />\ns1= \"bca\"<br />\nWriting s1 many times results in \"bcabcabcabca....\". Observe that<br />\n\"abcabcab\" is a substring. Thus \"bca\" is a repitition.\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>\nFirst line of the input will contain the no. of testcases T, followed<br />\nby T lines of test cases.<br />\nTest case starts with an integer X. Next there are X pairs of:<br />\nN and S, where N is a positive integer which tells the no. of times<br />\nS (sub-message) is repeated. For example, \"abcabcab\" can be written as \"2 abc 1 ab\".\n</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>Output will indicate the length of the smallest repetition possible,<br />\nseparated by a line.</p>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>T</b> \u2264 <b>10</b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>X</b> \u2264 <b>100</b></li>\n<li><b>The expanded text will contains 1 to 1000000 characters. </b></li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n3\n2 3 abc 1 ab\n1 1 babaaba\n4 1 ba 1 c 1 bacba 3 cba\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n3\n5\n3\n</pre>",
