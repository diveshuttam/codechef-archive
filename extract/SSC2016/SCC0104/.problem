On day they decide to sign a pact of friendship. Now you may be thinking what is the catch.<br />\nThey can trick each other one last day. <br />\nTom gives Jerry N pieces of Cheese stacked in a line. The pieces are numbered 1 to N and placed in bowls also numbered 1 to N.<br />\nTom adds a condition that Jerry has to eat the piece of cheese which is in bowl B. Jerry thought that it will be very easy to just go to the bowl and eat the cheese. <br />\nBut it is not that simple. First Jerry has to do a sequence of discards.<br />\nEach discard has the starting Bowl index (S) and an Ending bowl index (E) , Jerry has to throw away all the cheese that is in the bowls S through E (both inclusive). And then shift the adjacent pieces of cheese in the Empty bowls.</p>\n<p>For Example: <br /> If initial sequence is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9<br />\nand Discard is 3-4 then final Sequence will be 1 2 5 6 7 8 9 - -<br />\n<br />\nLets say Bowl B is the 3rd bowl, so Jerry can only eat Cheese with number 5 which is now present in Bowl 3.<br />\nNote that bowls 8 and 9 are now empty, so Jerry was to eat from Bowl 8 or 9 he will have nothing to eat.</p>\n<p>Help Jerry figure out which piece of cheese to eat.<br />\n<br />\n<b> The sequence of the discards has to be maintained For Example if Jerry has to discard index 3 - 4 and then index 4 - 5 He <i> cannot </i> remove first 4 - 5 and then 3 - 4.\n</b></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>Input description.<br />\nFirst line of input contains T, the number of Test cases<br />\nNext line contains N, the number of bowls/pieces of cheeze, B, the bowl in which jerry can eat, D, the number of discards<br />\nNext D lines the pair of integers S, start index of discard , E, end Index of Discard.\n</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>Output the Cheese number that Jerry will eat. Output -1 if Jerry has nothing to eat.\n</p>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b>1 &lt;= T &lt;= 1000</b></li>\n<li><b>1 &lt;= N &lt;= 10^9</b></li>\n<li><b>1 &lt;= B &lt;= N</b></li>\n<li><b>0 &lt;= D &lt;= 50</b></li>\n<li><b>1 &lt;= S &lt;= E &lt;= N</b></li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n2\n8 3 2\n3 4\n4 5\n4 3 2\n3 4\n4 4\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n5\n-1\n</pre>",
