He was taking random steps. But there was something unique with his steps. He would either take a step North or South or East or West as if he was walking on a rectangular grid.</p>\n<p>After each step the drunk man selects one of the four directions and moves one step further in the selected direction. Assuming that there is a probability (given in percentage) associated for going in every direction (East , West, North, South given by four integers E , W , N , S respectively). You have to tell Steve what is the probability that after taking K steps the drunken man never visited a location more than once.\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The input contains T test cases. For each test case you will be five space separated integers , K (number of  steps taken by the drunken man), E , W , N , S (the percentage chance of selecting East , West, North or South direction respectively).</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>For each test case, output a single line containing a double value denoting the probability that after taking K steps the drunken man visited a point only once.</p>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b>0</b> &lt; <b>T</b> \u2264 <b>100</b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>N</b> \u2264 <b>14</b></li>\n<li><b>0</b> \u2264 <b>E,W,N,S</b> \u2264 <b>100</b></li>\n<li>the sum of E,W,N,S will always be 100</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n2\n1 25 25 25 25\n2 25 25 25 25\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n1.000000\n0.750000\n</pre><p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p><b>Example case 1.</b> In this case drunk man can move in either of the four direction. Therefore the answer will be P(N)+P(S)+P(W)+P(E) = 0.25 + 0.25 + 0.25 + 0.25 = 1.000000</p>\n",
