First line of each test case contains N, the number of persons to be served on that day. The next N line contain two space separated integers H and M for that particular customer.</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>One line for each test, a integer denoting the min<br />\nimum number of coffee machines required.</p>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<p>Should contain all the constraints on the input data that you may have.
