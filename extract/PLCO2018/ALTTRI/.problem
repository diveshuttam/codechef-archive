Similarly he defined a right right angled triangle whose right angle was positioned on the right side. The triangle which he was viewing was a left right angled triangle with its base parallel to X-axis. \n</br></br>\nNow, he defined another terminology as Alterverted triangles. It was defined as triangles which can be drawn inside a right angled triangle in such a way that:\n</br></br>\n<ul>\n<li> It should also be a right angled triangle with the right angle on the opposite\n    side of its parents. </br></br>\n\n<li> Its base should lie on its parent triangle's base and the third vertex (excluding the base vertices) should lie on the hypotenuse of the parent triangle. </ul></br></br>\n\nNote: Here parent refers to the triangle inside which the current alterverted triangles are to be formed.\n\nConsidering the coordinate plane consisting only integer points. Zoro wants to find out how many Alterverted triangles he can obtain given a single triangle.\n</br>\nHelp Zoro to find out the answer.</p>\n\n<p>Triangles can be drawn inside the triangles which are drawn previously.</p>\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n\n<p>A single line containing coordinates of the 3 points x1,y1,x2,y2,x3,y3.\nThe given triangle has its base parallel to X axis. </p>\n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>A single integer denoting the count of the triangle.</p>\n\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<p>\n<ul>\n<li>-40 <= <b>x1,x2,x3</b> <= 40</br>\n<li>-40 <= <b>y1,y2,y3 </b><= 40</br>\n<li>1<= <b>(x3-x2)</b> <= 40</br>\n<li>1<= <b>(y1-y2)</b> <= 40</br>\n<li><b>x1 = x2</b> </br>\n<li><b>y2 = y3</b></ul></p>\n\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n0 3 0 0 3 0\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n3\n\n</pre>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p>First two triangles can be drawn with coordinates<b> {(1,2) , (1,0) , (0,0)} , {(2,1) , (2,0) , (1,0)} and {(2,1) , (2,0) , (0,0)}.</br> \n\n\nPlease refer to this example for more explanation.\nhttps://drive.google.com/open?id=13HGUMZFsTl6zFoNzsorU4G-6cLklve6l\n</b></p>",
