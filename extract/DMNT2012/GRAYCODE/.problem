Consider the number 3 in ordinary binary encoding: when incremented from 011 to 100 it is unlikely that all of the switches will change states at the same time, so there is a possibility of reading the state of the variable while it is in between a transition (i.e., when some of the bits have flipped to the correct value but others haven't).</p>\n\n<p>To solve this problem, Frank Gray introduced a new number system in which successive numbers differ by only a single bit.</p>\n\n<p>You are working on a legacy system that uses Gray codes, but are having difficulty fixing a bug related to multiplication of numbers. For the purpose of debugging, you wish to convert a number's Gray encoding into the corresponding decimal representation.</p>\n\n<h3>Input Format</h3>\n\n<p>The first line of input contains a single integer t, the number of test cases. This is followed by t lines, each containing a single integer, which is the result of converting the gray encoding directly to decimal. (For example, the gray encoding 100 which corresponds to 7 will be displayed as 4.)</p>\n\n<h3>Output Format</h3>\n\n<p>For each test case, output a single integer that is the decimal equivalent of the gray encoding.</p>\n\n<h3>Example</h3>\n\n<p>Input:</p>\n\n<pre><code>8\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Output:</p>\n\n<pre><code>0\n1\n3\n2\n7\n6\n4\n5\n\n</code></pre>",
