These lanes are fenced by government so that no one can cross any grid diagonally. Although a train </p>\n<p>line runs diagonally from (0,0) to (N,N).</p>\n<p>Our chef has a weird kind of phobia and is very afraid to cross the railway line. He is at point (0,0) and wants to get to the point (N,N). Calculate number of path </p>\n<p>through which it is possible to reach to its destination travelling the minimum distance. .</p>\n<p>Note that: </p>\n<p>\n1. Since he is already at position (0,0) he can go to either part of grid (i.e. left or right part - divided by diagonal) but he will remain in that part for the whole path.</p>\n<p>2. He is only afraid to \"cross\" the line, i.e. during the route he can go to position (m,m) where 0<m&lt;=N but he cannot cross it. </p>\n<p>3. You have to calculate the number of path possible. If there is more than one path then you have to print the number of path of minimum distances. </p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases, for each test case enter the grid size i.e value of N.</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>For each test case, output a single line with number of such paths possible.</p>\n<p>(Note : If no such path possible print 0)</p>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b>1</b> &lt;= <b>T</b> &lt;= <b>100</b></li>\n<li><b>0</b> &lt;= <b>N</b> &lt;= <b>30</b></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n2\n2\n5\n<b>Output:</b>\n4\n84\n</pre></m&lt;=n></p>",
