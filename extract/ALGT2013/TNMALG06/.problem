So much dumb that when his crush gave him her number he forgets it. But since little dumbo chef is such a good friend of yours you decided to help him. Here is some vague memories of the number that chef can recall :</p>\n<p>1.It is a palindrome.</p>\n<p>2.It is a prime number.</p>\n<p>3.It is of n digits ( 4 &lt; n &lt; 11 ).</p>\n<p>After digesting a memory enhancement pill he recalls (n-2) digits of the number. Now since the search criteria is so much narrowed, you are to write a program which prints number of possible candidates of the phone number of his crush.</p>\n<p>A number is a successful candidate if : </p>\n<p>1. It is prime and a palindrome.</p>\n<p>2. It is of n digits.</p>\n<p>3. Only deletion of two digits from the potential candidate makes it equal to the number which the chef has recalled.</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases, for each test case enter the number sequence recalled by chef of N - 2 digits and digits of original number i.e N</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>For each test case, output a single line with number of phone numbers possible.</p>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b>4</b> \u2264 <b>N</b> \u2264 <b>11</b></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n2\n37343 7\n57675 7\n<b>Output:</b>\n1\n1\n</pre><h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p><b>Case 1 :</b> 1 number is possible i.e  3743473</p>\n<p><b>Case 2 :</b> 1 number is possible i.e. 7576757</p>\n",
