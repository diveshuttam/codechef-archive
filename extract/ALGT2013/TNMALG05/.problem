So instead of going out, she decided to steal honey from its neighbors. This continued for a while but then this laziness made her fat. Now she can fly only for unit d distance. </p>\n\n<p>The honey bee hive, just like a regular hive is made up of MxN regular hexagonal compartments where the length of edge of hexagonal is k unit distance. You have to calculate from how many compartments she can potentially steal honey in single flight if the co-ordinate of center of leftmost and bottom most compartment is (0,0) and bee is currently at (x,y). </p>\n<p>\nNote: Assume that the honey is stored at the center of the hexagonal compartments and bee has to come back to its original position every time after stealing honey from a compartment.\n</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases, for each test case enter</p>\n<p>Maximum distance travelled by bee, current position of bee i.e. (x,y), size of hive (MxN), length of edge of hexagon.. All seperated by a single space.</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>For each test case, output a single line with number of compartments accessible to bee.</p>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>T</b> \u2264 <b>100</b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>M</b> \u2264 <b>100</b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>N</b> \u2264 <b>100</b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>D</b> \u2264 <b>100</b></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n<p>2</p><p>5 0 0 100 100 1</p><p>6 2 3 15 20 1</p>\n<b>Output:</b>\n<p></p><p>2</p><p>6</p>\n</pre><h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p><b>Case 1 : Since bee is at position (0,0) she can reach out to the compartment centered to at </b></p>\n<p>(1.73,0), (0.86),1.5)</p>\n<p><b>Case 2 : Since bee is at position (2,3) she can reach out to the compartment centered to at</b></p>\n<p> (2.59,1.5), (0,3), (0.88,1.5), (3.46,3), (0.88,4.5), (2.59,4.5)</p>\n",
