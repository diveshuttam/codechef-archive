In every move Knight jumps on 2n steps forward (n is number of block that he had travelled so far from starting) but after that he has to take either 1 step forward or backward.</p>\n<p>Now the Knight needs to get to position X so King (i.e. You) needs to decide the order of his backward or forward step in such a way that he can reach its destination in minimum number of steps. Remember he always travels in a straight line and the length of the board is infinite.</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases, for each test case enter value X ( i.e. destination)</p>\n<p>Note : initially knight is at n = 1.</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>For each test case the output should be string of numbers 1 &amp; 2 where 1 denotes backward step and 2 denote the forward step </p>\n<p>Note : for no solution print 0.</p>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>T</b> \u2264 <b>100</b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>X</b> \u2264 <b>10^10</b></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n2\n17\n10\n<b>Output:</b>\n2111\n0\n</pre><h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p><b>Case 1 :</b> starting from  n = 1 , knight moves to n = 3 ('2') , 5 ('1') , 9 ('1') , 17 ('1') i.e. string printed is 2 1 1 1</p>\n<p><b>Case 2 :</b> no solution is possible</p>\n",
