The objective is to fill a 9\u00d79 grid so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3\u00d73 boxes (also called blocks or regions) contains the digits from 1 to 9 only one time each. The puzzle setter provides a partially completed grid.\"\n\nThe rules for an N<sup>2</sup> X N<sup>2</sup> sudoku are as follows :\n<ul type=\"1\">\n<li>The board is consists of N<sup>2</sup> rows and N<sup>2</sup> columns.</li>\n<li>Numbers between 1 and N<sup>2</sup>(inclusive) are to be filled in each row such that :</li>\n<ul type=\"1\"><li>All numbers in each row are distinct.</li>\n<li>All numbers in each column are distinct.</li>\n<li>All numbers in the sub-matrix having rows from (i*N + 1) to(i + 1)*N, and columns from (j*N + 1) to (j + 1)*N both inclusive, should be distinct. 0 &lt;= i,j &lt;= N-1. Rows and columns are 1 indexed. Each such sub-matrix is called a \"box\" or \"region\".</li></ul>\n</ul>\n\nFor this problem, you are required to solve a general N<sup>2</sup>X N<sup>2</sup> sudoku puzzle. Given a partially filled sudoku board, you have to fill it in as \"perfect\" a manner as possible.\n<h3>\nInput :\n</h3></p><p>\nThe first line contains N,K.\nThe following K lines contain 3 numbers: x, y and d. 1 &lt;= x,y,d &lt;= N^2.\nThis means that a number d is present on the board at position (x,y)\n2 &lt;= N &lt;= 30\n0 &lt;= K &lt;= N<sup>4</sup>\nAt most 50% of the board will be covered at the start.\nAll positions (x,y) in the input will be unique.\n<h3>\nOutput :</h3></p><p>\nThe output consists of N<sup>2</sup> rows having N<sup>2</sup> numbers each. Each number should be between 1 and N<sup>2</sup> (inclusive) and separated by a space. If the initial grid has a number d at position (x,y), then even the output should have the number d at position (x,y).\n<h3>\nScoring :</h3></p><p>\n<ul>\n<li>\nFor each row and every number K in the range 1 to N<sup>2</sup> that is missing from the row, incurs a penalty of 1.</li>\n<li>For each column and every number K in the range 1 to N<sup>2</sup> that is missing from the column, incurs a penalty of 1.</li>\n<li>Similary, for each box and every number K in the range 1 to N<sup>2</sup> that is missing from the box, incurs a penalty of 1.</li></ul>\nA box (as explained above) is a N X N square and the grid can be divided into N<sup>2</sup> such non-overlapping boxes.\n<h3>\nExample :</h3></p><p>\n<h3>\nInput:</h3>\n<pre>\n2 4\n1 2 1\n2 4 4\n3 3 1\n4 1 3\n</pre><h3>\nOutput:</h3>\n<pre>\n2 1 3 4\n1 2 4 4\n3 4 1 2\n3 2 4 1\n</pre>\n<h3>\nPenalty:</h3> (0 + 1 + 0 + 0) + (1 + 1 + 1 + 1) + (2 + 2 + 1 + 1) = 11</p>",
