However, all the participants are expected to abide to <a href=\"https://discuss.codechef.com/questions/18662/does-  codechef-have-any-code-of-conduct\">CodeChef Code Of Conduct</a>.</p> </div> <p><br /> <b class=\"rules-heading\">What is it for you?</b></p> <div class=\"rules-body\"> <p>The idea behind these programming contests is that we want you to learn while competing. Also we believe that it is alright to refer to tutorials, books and other materials, learn a concept and then apply the same to solve a problem during a contest. But it is <b>not alright to copy other people's solutions or seek other people's help to solve a problem without understanding it.</b> The dividing line may seem to be thin but it can be captured by the spirit of learning. If whatever you are doing is making you learn while you do so, we tend to believe that it is alright.</p> <br /> <p>Not just that, as a token of motivation we also give away cash prizes and goodies to the winners of the contest. However, our sole intention lies in making our users learn new concepts while competing.</p> <b class=\"rules-heading\">For Indians:</b> <ul class=\"\"> <li>Top 10 from ranklist will get CodeChef laddus</li> </ul> <b class=\"rules-heading\">For Rest of World:</b> <ul class=\"\"> <li>Top 10 from ranklist will get CodeChef laddus</li> </ul> <div class=\"rules-body\"> <p>With CodeChef laddus, the winners can claim cool CodeChef goodies.
