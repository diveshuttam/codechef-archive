This is because, in many cases (default) stack limit of 8MB is not sufficient for the recursive calls. And you might get SIGSEGV runtime error. In\u00a0<b>some cases</b>, where state space is less but depth is 100000 or so, may pass.</p>\r\n<p>This is just a suggestion. Rest is upto the contestants to decide, what is better way for them to write code.</p>",
