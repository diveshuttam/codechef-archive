During the match, an ice cream guy arrives. Now Sucho wants his students to form a line to avoid chaos. But being a caring teacher, he wants his students to form the line with the least possible moves.<br />\nAll his students are scattered around the field and their position is given by a pair (x, y) of integer coordinates. Students can move- in one move, one student can go 1 unit up, down, left or right(hence, he can change his x or his y co-ordinate by 1 or -1 in one move).<br />\nThe students want to get into a horizontal line next to each other (so that their final positions are (x, y), (x+1, y), \u2026, (x+N-1, y), for some x and y). Integers x and y, as well as the final order of soldiers along the horizontal line is arbitrary.<br />\nTwo or more students can never occupy the same position at the same time.<br />\nSucho is busy managing his students. Can you help him determine the minimum total number of moves of all the students that takes them into such configuration?/p></p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The first line contains N, the total number of students present on the field.<br />\nThe next N lines contain the initial position of each student. For each i, 1 \u2264 i \u2264 N, the (i+1)th line contains a pair of integers x[i] &amp; y[i] separated by a single space, representing the coordinates of the ith student.\n</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>The output should contain one number which is the minimum total number of moves that the students makes to get into a horizontal line next to each other.</p>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>0\u2264 <b>N</b> \u226410^5 </li>\n<li>-10000 \u2264 x[i], y[i] \u2264 10000</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n<p>3\n1 0\n2 4\n3 2\n</p>\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n<p>4\n</p></pre>",
