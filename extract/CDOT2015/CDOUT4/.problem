There are <b>N</b> flower pots in his garden arranged in a single queue which are numbered <b>N1, N2, N3, N4\u2026</b>Now, Piyush wants to arrange these flowerpots in an ascending order on the same queue on the basis of the numbers on them. But then he realized he is gaining weight and decided to use this flowerpot arrangement task as a workout. So, he modified the task a bit. He will arrange the flowerpots in ascending order but he will place the flowerpots in such a way that he has to walk more to place them in their correct position. Now he wants to know the longest distance he covered while placing a flowerpot. Piyush has to pick a flowerpot and place it in the longest possible position in one chance. He doesn\u2019t want to pick up a flowerpot twice.</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The First line contains an integer <b>T</b> denoting the number of test cases. The description of <b>T</b> test cases follows.<br />\nThe first line of each test case is a single integer <b>N</b> which is the number of flowerpots. The next <b>N</b> lines contains integers which are the numbers on the flowerpots.\n</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>For each test case output a single integer which denotes the longest distance he covered while placing a flowerpot.</p>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>1\u2264 <b>T</b> \u226410 </li>\n<li>0\u2264 <b>N</b> \u226410^5 </li>\n<li>0\u2264 <b>Number on the Flowerpot</b> \u226410^5 </li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n<p>2\n5\n5 4 3 2 1\n6\n7 7 7 7 7 7\n</p>\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n<p>4\n5\n</p></pre><h3>Explanation</h3>\n<pre>\n<p><b>Example case 1.</b> The longest distance he covered was placing 5 on the 5th position\n<b>Example case 2.</b> The longest distance he covered was placing the 7 in position 1 to the 6th position.</p></pre>",
