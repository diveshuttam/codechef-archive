They want to celebrate the Blanchett's victory for winning Best Actress Oscars Award.</p>\n<p>They love to travel by trains. So,they planned to visit Metro Land. It consists of <b>n</b> stations connected by <b>m</b> railway tracks. Between two stations there is a single two-way track. All stations are reachable from each other.</p>\n<p>As Amy and Blanchett\u2019s homeplaces are very far from each other , they reached the Disney Land directly at stations <b>i</b> and <b>j</b> respectively.But Amy forgot her phone at home, so they were unable to contact each other.</p>\n<p>In the hope of meeting each other luckily, both of them followed a strategy.<br />\nAt each station <b>i</b>, Amy or Blanchett can decide to stay there with probability <b>pi</b> or can decide to move with probability <b>(1-pi)</b> by choosing one of the tracks going from station i with equal probability. </p>\n<p>E.g. If total <b>l</b> tracks go from station <b>i</b>, then they can choose the track going to station <b>j</b> with probability <b>(1-pi)/l</b>.\n</p>\n<p>\nYour task is  to help two friends in meeting each other by finding the probability of their meeting at each station<br />\n<b>i</b>.\n</p>\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>\nThe first line contains four integers: <b>n</b> representing the numbers of stations. <b>m</b> representing the number of tracks. <b>i , j</b> representing the starting stations of Amy and Blanchett respectively.</p>\n<p>Next <b>m</b> lines contain pairs of numbers \u2014 the numbers of stations connected by a track. </p>\n<p>Next <b>n</b> lines contain probabilities <b>pi</b> with the accuracy of up to two digits after the decimal point \u2014 the probability to stay at station <b>i</b>.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>In the <b>n</b> lines print <b>n</b> numbers, the number on <b>ith</b> line should represent the probability that the friends meet at the <b>ith</b> station rounded upto <b>6</b> decimal places.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>n</b> \u2264 <b>20</b></li>\n<li><b>n-1</b> \u2264 <b>m</b> \u2264 <b>(n*(n-1))/2</b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>i,j</b> \u2264 <b>n</b><b>  (i and j can be equal.)</b></li>\n<li><b>0.01</b> \u2264 <b>pi</b> \u2264 <b>0.99</b></li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre>\n<b>Sample Input 1:</b>\n3 3 1 1\n1 2\n2 3\n3 1\n0.50\n0.50\n0.50\n\n<b>Sample Output 1:</b>\n1.000000\n0.000000\n0.000000\n\n\n<b>Sample Input 2:</b>\n3 3 1 2\n1 2\n1 3\n2 3\n0.50\n0.50\n0.50\n\n<b>Sample Output 2:</b>\n0.357143 \n0.357143 \n0.285714\n</pre><p>\u00a0</p>\n",
