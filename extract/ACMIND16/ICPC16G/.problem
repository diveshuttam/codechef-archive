    "body": "<p>Today is the Robolympics athletic event. <b>N</b> batons numbered 0 to <b>N - 1</b> are placed in a circular fashion where baton numbers increase in clockwise direction. Also, some of the batons are <i>special</i>. <b>M</b> robots start in the event by standing near a baton position and picking it up. Note that a baton cannot be held by more than one robot, therefore all robots have distinct positions in the circular array of batons.</p>\n\n<p>Now, this event lasts for <b>N</b> seconds. In each second, each robot drops the baton currently in its hand and moves to next position in clockwise direction <i>i.e.</i> if a robot has baton <b>i</b> in its hand at <b>t = 0</b>, at <b>t = 1</b> he will be holding baton <b>(i + 1) % N</b>.\n</p>\n\n<p>Crowd goes berserk whenever there comes a moment when all robots have picked up <i>special</i> batons. Your aim is to count how many times it will happen during the whole race. Note that crowd can go berserk even at <b>t = 0</b>. But since race is over at <b>t = N</b>, crowd doesn't care anymore. e. The crowd will not go berserk at <b>t = N</b>.</p>\n\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>First line contains <b>N</b> and <b>M</b> denoting the number of batons and number of robots participating in the event. Next line contains <b>N</b> space separated integers where <b>i</b><sup>th</sup> integer is 0 or 1 denoting whether baton numbered <b>i - 1</b> is <i>special</i> or not. Next line contains <b>M</b> integers denoting the index(0 to N-1) of initial baton that robots have picked up.</p>\n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>Output one and only integer denoting the required answer.</p>\n\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>N</b> \u2264 <b>5*10<sup>5</sup></b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>M</b> \u2264 <b>N</sup></b></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input 1:</b>\n3 1\n1 0 1\n0\n\n<b>Output 1:</b>\n2\n\n<pre><b>Input 2:</b>\n4 2\n1 0 1 0\n1 3\n\n<b>Output 2:</b>\n2\n</pre>\n<h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p><b>Example input 1.</b> <br/>\nBatons numbered 0 and 2 are <i>special</i>.\nBatons held by robots at <b>t = 0</b>: [0]\nBatons held by robots at <b>t = 1</b>: [1]\nBatons held by robots at <b>t = 2</b>: [2]\n\nNote that at <b>t = 0, 2</b> all robots have special batons held.\n<br/>\n<b>Example input 2.</b> <br/>\nBatons numbered 0 and 2 are <i>special</i>.\nBatons held by robots at <b>t = 0</b>: [1, 3]\nBatons held by robots at <b>t = 1</b>: [2, 0]\nBatons held by robots at <b>t = 2</b>: [3, 1]\nBatons held by robots at <b>t = 3</b>: [0, 2]\n\nNote that at <b>t = 1, 3</b> all robots have special batons held.\n</p>",
