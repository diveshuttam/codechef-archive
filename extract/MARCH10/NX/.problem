There are N important places in Byteland that need to be considered.</p>\n<p>These N buildings can be represented by N points in a 2D plane. The cellphone tower can be represented by a circle, and in order to construct the tower, ByteTel needs to specify its center and radius.\n</p><p>Moreover, the center of the tower cannot be outside the secure area, which is also a circle.\n</p><p>ByteTel wants to find a center and radius for the tower such that <b>the total squared distance</b> between each of the building and the tower is as small as possible.\n</p><p>The distance between a point and a circle is defined to be the difference between the distance from the circle's center to the point and the circle's radius.\n</p><p>Your task is to help ByteTel find a center and radius for their cellphone tower.\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n</p><p>The first line contains a number t (about 10), which is the number of test case. Each test case has the following form.</p>\n<p>The first line contains three numbers (X<sub>s</sub>, Y<sub>s</sub>) and R<sub>s</sub>, specifying the secure circle.\n</p><p>The second line contains N, the number of buildings (1 \u2264 N \u2264 100).</p>\n<p>Each line in the next N lines contain two numbers which are the coordinates of a building.\n</p><p>All coordinates are integer and are between 0 and 10000 (inclusive).</p>\n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>For each test case, output 3 numbers (X,Y) and R, rounded to 3 decimal digits, which are the center and radius of the cellphone tower. \n\n<h3>Scoring</h3>\n</p><p>For each test case, your score is d/D in which:\n</p><p>d is the total square distance between each of the building and the tower your program has found \n</p><p>D is the total square distance between each of the building and the secure circle's center.\n</p><p>Your program's score is the sum of each test case's score, the lower the better.\n<h3>Example</h3>\n\n<pre>\n<b>Input:</b>\n1\n\n1 1 4\n5\n3 -2\n2 1\n5 3\n4 3\n4 -1\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n4.000 1.000 2.000\n</pre>\n\n</p><p>The sample output's score is 0.023444. The secure circle is red and the tower is yellow.</p>\n\n<img src='https://www.spoj.pl/content/paulmcvn:circle.png' />",
