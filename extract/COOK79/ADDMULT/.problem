In each turn, the player should choose two adjacent integers from the sequence, remove them, and put in their place either their sum or their product. So if the sequence is <b>(5,17,2,4,102)</b>, then one valid move would be to select <b>2</b> and <b>4</b>, and replace them with their product, which is <b>8</b>. So the sequence now becomes <b>(5,17,8,102)</b>. They could also have been replaced by their sum, and in that case, the new sequence would become <b>(5,17,6,102)</b>.</p>\n\n<p>The game continues until there's only one integer left in the sequence. If this integer is even, then Chef is the winner, otherwise Chefu is the winner.</p>\n\n<p>Given the initial sequence and the player who will play the first turn, you should tell who is going to win the game assuming that both of them play optimally.</p>\n\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The first line of the input contains an integer <b>T</b> denoting the number of test cases.</p>\n\n<p>First line of each test-case contains <b>N</b>, the length of the initial sequence. and a string which is either \"Chef\" or \"Chefu\" denoting who will play first.</p>\n\n<p>The second line contains <b>N</b> space-separated integers <b>A<sub>1</sub></b>, <b>A<sub>2</sub></b>, ..., <b>A<sub>N</sub></b> denoting the initial sequence.\n </p>\n\n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>For each test case, output a single line containing who will win the game: \"Chef\" or \"Chefu\".</p>\n\n\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>T</b> \u2264 <b>10,000</b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>N</b> \u2264 <b>100,000</b></li>\n<li>sum of <b>N</b> in all test-cases will not exceed <b>100,000</b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264  <b>A<sub>i</sub> </b> \u2264 <b>50</b>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n2\n1 Chef\n8\n3 Chef\n1 2 3\n\n<b>Output:</b>\nChef\nChefu\n</pre>\n\n<h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p><b>Test case 1:</b> The game stops as soon as it begins, because there is only one integer, and because it is even, Chef wins.</p>\n\n<p><b>Test case 2:</b> Chef has 4 valid first moves:\n<ul>\n<li>Add 1 and 2, and change the sequence to (3,3). Now Chefu will multiply these two, and get 9, and win, because only one integer is left, and it is odd.</li>\n<li>Multiply 1 and 2, and change the sequence to (2,3). Now Chefu will add these two, and get 5, and win, because only one integer is left, and it is odd.</li>\n<li>Add 2 and 3, and change the sequence to (1,5). Now Chefu will multiply these two, and get 5, and win, because only one integer is left, and it is odd.</li>\n<li>Multiply 2 and 3, and change the sequence to (1,6). Now Chefu will add these two, and get 7, and win, because only one integer is left, and it is odd.</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAs we can see, for every possible move of Chef, Chefu has a move that lets him win. Hence, in optimal play, Chefu will win.\n</p>",
