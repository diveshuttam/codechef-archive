Cell i is adjacent to cells (i-1) and (i+1) and cells 1 and N are also\nadjacent. You can cut the circle between two indices and you have to make two such cuts so that the circle breaks in to two arcs, with each\ncell in one of them. Each arc should have at least one cell in it.</p>\n\n<p>Given a circular array of N cells, find the number of ways in which you can break it in to two arcs such that sum of values in the cells in\nthe two arcs are same. Two ways of breaking are different if there is at least one pair of cells (i,j) such that, both i and j belong to \nthe same arc in one and to different arcs in the other.</p>\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The first line contains the number of test cases T. T cases follow. Each test case consists of N in the first line followed by N space\nseparated integers on the next line denoting the values A[1..N]</p>\n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>Output T lines, one for each case containing the required answer.</p>\n\n\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<pre>\n1 <= T <= 10\n3 <= N <= 100000\n-1000 < A[i] < 1000\n\n<b>Input:</b>\n2\n3\n2 5 3\n6\n2 -1 0 1 1 1\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n1\n4\n<pre>\n\n<b>Explanation of case 2:</b>\n<p>The 4 possible breaks are shown below\n{2} {-1,0,1,1,1}\n{2,-1,0,1} {1,1}\n{0,1,1} {1,2,-1}\n{1,1} {1,2,-1,0}\n</p>",
