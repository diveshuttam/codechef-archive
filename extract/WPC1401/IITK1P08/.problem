    "body": "<span class=\"solution-visible-txt\">All submissions for this problem are available.</span><p>\nYou are a bird shooting enthusiast. You are standing on position 0 and a flock of birds (assume infinitely many birds) is flying away from you at 1m/s.<br />\nThe flock of birds is initially at 1m away from you.\n</p>\n<p>\nYour rating is (P, N) and your time lag is (T, R). This means the following.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\nIf P is your precision rating : At every turn, beginning when the birds are at 1m position, you take a shot at one of the birds in the flock.<br />\nSuppose at this turn, if the flock of birds is Xm away from you, then probability that shot is successful is 1 &frasl; X<sup>P</sup>.\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>N is your range : You can only shoot at the flock of birds if it is at a distance less than or equal to N.\n</p></li>\n<li>\nT is your reload time : After every shot, you reload your gun, and that takes time T. The next time you shoot, thus the flock of birds is T more meters away than it initially was.\n</li>\n<li>\nR is your rejoicing time :D : If you are successful in shooting a bird, you rejoice your success and spend an extra amount of time R in reloading<br />\n(taking a total of T + R time before the next shot).\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>\nAssume that you have infinitely many bullets.\n</p>\n<p>\nGiven N, P, T, and R. Find the expected number of birds you will shoot down!\n</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>\nA single line containing space separated 4 numbers N, P, T, and R, in that order. P is a real number while others are positive integers.</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>\nA single line containing the expected number of birds you will shoot down. The output should be correct to within 10^(-6) of the actual answer.\n</p>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<p><ul>\n<li> P is a real number, 1 &lt; P &lt; 100 </li>\n<li> 1 &le; N &le; 10^18 </li>\n<li> 1 &le; T &le; 10^5 </li>\n<li> 1 &le; R &le; 10^5 </li>\n<li> Further, ln(N) &lt; 14 (P - 1) </li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n10 2 3 4\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n1.015625\n</pre>",
