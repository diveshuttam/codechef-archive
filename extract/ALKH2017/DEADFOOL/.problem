I can\u2019t tell you his name, but it rhymes with \u2018pullverine' \" </b></i>  \n<p><b>Deadpool</b> and <b>Wolverine</b> go head to head in a crazy game on Crazy Country.</p>\n<p> Let\u2019s first get some details about <b>Crazy country</b>. The Crazy Country has <b>N</b> cities. It is possible to go from one city to any other city in Crazy Country And there is a <b>unique path between every pair of cities</b>. <b>City 1 is the capital city</b> and it located at level 0.  Every city in this country is assigned a <b>level which is equal to its </b>distance from the capital city. </p>\n<p> <b> Distance between cities A and B = number of cities encountered while going from city A to city B (excluding both) + 1.  </b> </p>\n<p> Every city in this crazy country has a certain number of aircrafts in it. Deadpool has designed these really cool aircrafts. Every aircraft contains some <b>Cool Buttons</b>. Each button has a Coolness associated with it. Initially, each aircraft has exactly 1 button of Coolness <b>C</b>, for all integers <b>C &ge; 1</b>. When a functional button with <b>Coolness X</b> on a aircraft lying in city of <b>level L</b> is pressed, it takes the aircraft to a city of <b>level (L-X)</b> which lies on the path between this city and the capital city (obviously , there is only one such city). Of course , the buttons with <b>Coolness > L</b> are dysfunctional in an aircraft which is in city of level <b>L</b> as the aircrafts are not allowed to go beyond the capital city. </p>\n<p> Plus , there is something really weird about these aircrafts,  whenever you press a button with a particular Coolness <b>X</b> then <b>all the buttons of this aircraft become dysfunctional  that are of Coolness (I*X) , where I >= 1.</b> </p>\n<p> Now, Deadpool and Wolverine <b>take turns</b> and press a functional Cool button on any one of the aircrafts of their choice. <b>The Player who can\u2019t make a move loses</b>.  Being the smart guys that they are, they obviously play <b>optimally</b>. </p>\n<p>Given a crazy country setup, you have to <b>determine who will win this game if Deadpool makes the first move.</b></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>First line contains an integer <b>T</b> denoting the number of test cases.</p>\n<p>First line of every test case contains <b>N</b> \u2013 The number of cities in the Crazy Country.</p>\n<p>Second line of every test case contains <b>N</b> integers, where <b>i<sup>th</sup></b> integer signifies <b>number of aircrafts</b> in <b>i<sup>th</sup></b> city.</p>\n<p>Next <b>N-1</b> lines follow- each line has <b>2 integers A and B</b>, showing that there is a <b>direct path</b> between city <b>A</b> and city <b>B</b>. </p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>If Deadpool wins then print \u201c<b>Deadpool</b>\u201d(without quotes) else print \u201c<b>Wolverine</b>\u201d(without quotes).</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>1 \u2264 <b>T</b> \u2264 100</li>\n<li>1 \u2264 <b>N</b> \u2264 10000</li>\n<li>0 \u2264 <b>Number of aircrafts in one city of Crazy Country</b> \u2264 50000</li>\n<li>1 \u2264 <b>A,B</b> \u2264 <b>N</b></li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<p><b>Input:</b></p>\n<p>1</p>\n<p>3</p>\n<p>0 0 1 </p>\n<p>1 2</p>\n<p>1 3</p>\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n<p>Deadpool</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p>Deadpool moves the aircraft from city 3 to city 1 by pressing the button with Coolness 1 in the first move. Now, Wolverine loses as he can\u2019t make any move.</p>",
