Each query will contain 5 integers <b>R A B X</b> and <b>Y</b>.<br>\n<b>R</b> denotes the root node of the tree for the particular query.<br>\n<b>A</b> denotes the cost of an edge if one traverses from a node to its parent node.<br>\n<b>B</b> denotes the cost of an edge if one traverses from a node to its child node.<br>\nConsider 2 friends are standing at nodes <b>X</b> and <b>Y</b> respectively. They both need to meet and can meet at any node. Logan need to tell Laura what is the minimum cost they both need to pay to meet?<br><br>\n\nAfter a person travels through an edge (his current location gets updated), he needs to pay the cost which is equal to <b>C * cost of edge</b> where <b>C</b> is a factor whose value is equal to total edges traveled by a person from his starting location and upto his current location and <b>cost of edge</b> will be either equal to <b>A</b> or <b>B</b> depending upon the person's movement.\n<br>\nSee sample input output for better understanding.\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>\nFirst line contains an integer <b>N</b> denoting number of nodes in tree.<br>\nNext <b>N-1</b> lines contains two integers <b>U</b> and <b>V</b> denoting that there is an edge between node <b>U</b> and node <b>V</b>.<br>\nNext line contains an integer <b>Q</b> denoting number of queries.<br>\nNext <b>Q</b> lines contains five integers <b>R, A, B, X</b> and <b>Y</b> respectively.\n</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>For each query print required answer in a separate line.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>1 \u2264 <b>N</b> \u2264 10<sup>5</sup></li>\n<li> 1 \u2264 <b>U, V, R, X, Y</b> \u2264 <b>N</b></li>\n<li> 1 \u2264 <b>Q</b> \u2264 <b>10<sup>5</sup></b></li>\n<li> 1 \u2264 <b>A, B</b> \u2264 10<sup>6</sup></li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n8\n1 2\n5 6\n5 3\n4 3\n8 2\n3 1\n7 5\n3\n3 5 2 3 2\n5 8 12 8 7\n1 10 2 4 7\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n6\n80\n20\n</pre>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p><b>Query 1</b> : Following will be the tree orientation as root node is given as 3.<br>\n<img src='https://s18.postimg.org/sqss7tzop/image.jpg'><br>\n</p>\nConsider both friends meet at node 3 than :\n<ul>\n<li>2<sup>nd</sup> friend will move from node 2 to node 1.
