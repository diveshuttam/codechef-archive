At CodeChef, we work hard to revive the geek in  you by hosting a programming contest at the start of the month and  another smaller programming challenge in the middle of the month.</p>\r\n<h4>About CodeChef August Long Challenge:</h4>\r\n<p class=\"last\">CodeChef Long Challenge is a 10-day monthly coding  contest where you can show off your computer programming skills. The  significance being - it gives you enough time to think about a problem,  try different ways of attacking the problem, read the concepts etc. If  you\u2019re usually slow at solving problems and have ample time at hand,  this is ideal for you. We also put in a lot of efforts in getting  quality problems, which would, in turn, foster your learning while  solving them.</p>\r\n<h4>Contest Details:</h4>\r\n<ul class=\"last\">\r\n<li><strong>Duration: </strong>10 Days, From 3rd August 1500 hrs IST to 13th\u00a0August 1500 hrs IST. Check your timezone <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=CodeChef+August+Challenge+2018&amp;iso=20180803T15&amp;p1=44\">here</a>.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>Eligibility Criteria: Anyone with a knack for Programming :P</h4>\r\n<p class=\"last\">Our contests are open to all the programmers across the globe.</p>\r\n<h4>What's in it for you?</h4>\r\n<p>The idea behind these programming contests is that we want you to  learn while competing. Also we believe that it is alright to refer to  tutorials, books and other materials, learn a concept and then apply the  same to solve a problem during a contest. But it is not alright to copy  other people's solutions or seek other people's help to solve a problem  without understanding it. The dividing line may seem to be thin but it  can be captured by the spirit of learning. If whatever you are doing is  making you learn while you do so, we tend to believe that it is alright.  However, all the participants are expected to abide to <a href=\"/codeofconduct\">CodeChef Code Of Conduct</a></p>\r\n<p>Not just that, as a token of motivation we also give away cash prizes  and goodies to the winners of the contest. However, our sole intention  lies in making our users learn new concepts while competing. You can  know more about prizes <a href=\"http://discuss.codechef.com/questions/51999/how-do-i-win-a-codechef-goodie\">here</a>.</p>\r\n<div><strong><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\">Rules and Regulations:</span></strong></div>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Please do not discuss strategy, suggestions or tips in the comments  during a live contest. Posting questions clarifying the problem  statement is ok. If you are unsure, email us at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:feedback@codechef.com\"> feedback@codechef.com</a>.</li>\r\n<li>All the problems will be partially graded and you will get a score  for passing certain test data (except tie-breaker problem). You will  receive hundred (100) points for solving a problem (passing all test  cases).</li>\r\n<li>The details of the failed test cases will also be visible on your solution page (except challenge problem)</li>\r\n<li>You can submit solutions as many times as you'd like, there are no penalties for incorrect submissions.</li>\r\n<li>Each contest will have one min/max tie breaker problem, where the  best solution will receive one point and all other solutions will  receive a fraction based how close they come to the best solution.</li>\r\n<li>You shall not possess more than one account on CodeChef. If you  have, then do let us know, so that we can deactivate the insignificant  one. If you do not report it and we come to know about it, we may  deactivate both the accounts permanently.</li>\r\n<li>The score that you will see during the contest (for tie-breaker /  challenge problem), will only be partial (scored on 20% of the test  data). The submissions will be re-judged at the end of the contest to  get a full score (scored on the whole test data).</li>\r\n<li>Similarly, for the challenge problem, the time and memory  consumption shown for a submission will be the maximum of the  corresponding metric on only the 20% of the test files on which it is  being scored now. You will still get a WA/TLE/MLE verdict if your  submission fails in the remaining 80% of the test files.</li>\r\n<li>The number of submissions that one can make during the contest on  the problem will be limited to 500 and the maximum number of submissions  allowed in the challenge problem are limited to 100.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Note: You can now \"Code, Compile, and Run\" your codes on our <a href=\"/ide\">Online IDE</a>.</strong></p>\r\n<p>However, if you are using any other online development environment,  make sure that other contestants don't have access to your code. As a  contestant, you are responsible for making sure others don't access the  code that you submit. <strong>If you use Ideone, make sure to mark your submission \"private\" (not secret)\".</strong></p>",
