    "body": "<span class=\"solution-visible-txt\">All submissions for this problem are available.</span><p></p>\n<p>Lets define <i>G(x, {A<sub>1</sub>, A<sub>2</sub>, A<sub>3</sub>, ..., A<sub>x</sub>})</i> as a game played by 2 players in which we have <i>x</i> piles of stones with ith pile having <i>A<sub>i</sub></i> stones. Player 1 moves first. The players move alternatively. In a move a player can select a single non empty pile of stones and remove any number ( > 0 ) of stones from it. When a player cannot make a move, the player loses.<br><br>\n\nAdarsh and Saharsh are playing a modification of this game. There are <b>N</b> piles of stones lined up and ith pile has <b>A<sub>i</sub></b> number of stones. Saharsh needs to divide the <b>N</b> piles into disjoint contiguous segments. It is possible for a pile to not belong in a segment at all. The segments need to be selected in such a way such that, if ith pile is in a segment, then all the j's such that <b>A<sub>i</sub></b> = <b>A<sub>j</sub></b>, are also in the segment. Now they play games on these segments considering only the 'distinct sized piles' in the segment with Adarsh as Player 1 and Saharsh as Player 2.<br><br>\n\nConsider A = {1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 2}.<br>\n<ul>\n  <li>A possible division is {1, 1} and {2, 3, 3, 2}. <br>\n  For the segment {1, 1}, game <i>G(1, {1})</i> would be played. For the segment {2, 3, 3, 2}, game <i>G(2, {2, 3})</i> would be played.\n      <ul>\n      <li><i>G(1, {1})</i> would be won by Player 1</li>\n      <li><i>G(2, {2, 3})</i> would be won by Player 1</li>\n      </ul>\n  So number of games that Player 2 wins would be 0.</li><br>\n\n  <li>Another possible division is {1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 2}. <br>\n  For the segment {1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 2}, game <i>G(3, {1, 2, 3})</i> would be played. \n      <ul><li><i>G(3, {1, 2, 3})</i> would be won by Player 2</li></ul>\n  So number of games that Player 2 wins would be 1.</li>\n</ul><br>\n\nWhat is the maximum possible games that Saharsh can win?<br>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<h3>Input Format:</h3> \nThe first line contains an integer <b>N</b>, the number of piles.<br>\nNext line contains <b>N</b> space separated integers where ith integer denotes number of stones in the ith pile, <b>A<sub>i</sub></b>.\n\n<h3>Output Format:</h3>\nFor each test case, output the corresponding answer.\n\n<h3>Constraints:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>1<= <b>N</b> <=500000</li>\n<li>1<= <b>A<sub>i</sub></b> <=500000</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Sample Input:</h3>\n6<br>\n1 1 2 3 3 2\n\n<h3>Sample Output:</h3>\n1\n\n<h3>Explanation:</h3>\nGiven in the problem statement.",
