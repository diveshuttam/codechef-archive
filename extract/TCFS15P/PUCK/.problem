There are <b>N</b> apple trees in the orchard <b>numbering 1 to N</b>. Morpheus in recent busy designing the 'dreams' so he  needed a keeper of the orchard who could maintain the count of apples and inform on instantly about them. He picks you for the job and offers a handsome pay. You happily agree. Puck, the servant  of Morpheus, is very clever and mischievous. He loves to mess with things. So your trouble starts now.<br />\n\u00a0</p>\n<p>\nPuck would on any visit to an apple tree may decide to use his magic potions to <b>increase the count of apple by 1 or leave the count</b> as it is. Puck visits the orchard daily. He selects a contiguous range of trees <b>[l, r] </b> and apply potions on some of trees of the range to achieve following</p>\n<ul>\n<li> convert count of apples in each tree in the given range to even count</li>\n<li> convert count of apples in each tree in range to odd count</li>\n<li> convert count of apples in trees with odd count to even count and trees with even count to odd count.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>But luckily he maintains a diary for the operation he does and you have access to the diary. Now at the end of day Morpheus may ask you the <b>count of apples in range [l, r] </b>. And your job is to answer him correctly for each such question otherwise you may not be allowed to return back from dream world ever.\n</p>\n<p>Initially the trees had some apples on them and luckily you are told the count before the job.<br />\n\n</p><p>\nConsider [<b>a<sub>1</sub></b>, <b>a<sub>2</sub></b>, ... <b>a<sub>n</sub></b>] initial count of apples on trees. <b>a<sub>i</sub></b> = count of apples on <b>i<sub>th</sub></b> tree.<br />\nEach operation of Puck is described as</p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>O L R </b> -> change all counts in this range to odd</li>\n<li><b>E L R </b> -> change all counts in this range to even</li>\n<li><b>I L R </b> -> change even counts to odd and odd to even</li>\n<li><b>M L R </b> -> print the answer to sum of counts for trees in range<b> [L, R] </b></li>\n<ul>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>Input description.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>First line contains an integer <b>N</b> denoting the number of trees</li>\n<li>Next line contains <b>N space separated integers denoting <b>a<sub>1</sub></b>, <b>a<sub>2</sub></b> ... <b>a<sub>n</sub></b></b></li>\n<li>The next line contains integer <b>Q</b> , number of operations\n</li><li>Each of next Q lines contains on of the operation as described in the problem description</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>Output the count of apples for each of the query asked by Morpheus in separate lines</p>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>N</b> \u2264 <b>10^6</b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>a<sub>i</sub></b> \u2264 <b>10^3</b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>Q</b> \u2264 <b>10^4</b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>L</b> \u2264 <b>R</b> \u2264 <b>N</b></li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n6\n1 1 1 0 2 1\n5\nE 2 3\nO 4 6\nI 2 5\nM 1 3\nM 2 5\n \n<b>Output:</b>\n7\n12\n</pre><p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p><b>Example case 1.</b><br /><br />\nAfter E 2 3 ,   Array -> 1 2 2 0 2 1<br /><br />\nAfter O 4 6,    Array -> 1 2 2 1 3 1<br /><br />\nAfter I 2 5,      Array -> 1 3 3 2 4 2<br /><br />\nM 1 3 -> 1 + 3 + 3 = 7<br /><br />\nM 2 5 -> 3 + 3 + 2 + 4 = 12<br />\n</p>\n</ul></ul>",
