He suspects that teachers might be giving grace marks to uplift grade of those near the grade-cutoff, or maybe skipping partial marking.</p>\n<p>There are 5 subjects in the school, labelled A to E. Each student gets marks out of 100 (i.e., integer marks in the inclusive range [0,100]). A mark is said to be <i>over-given</i> for a subject if that mark is obtained by strictly more than 10% of the class in that subject. For each of the subjects (A to E), list the marks that are <i>over-given</i> in that subject.</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>First line contains <b>N</b>, the number of marks in the list. Then N lines follow.<br />Each of the next N lines contains one character from the set {A,B,C,D,E} followed by a space, then a number in inclusive range[0,100].</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>Print 5 lines, one for each subject A,B,C,D, and E respectively. In each line print in ascending order the marks that are <i>over-given</i> for that subject. If for a subject none of the marks are <i>over-given</i> then print \"Nothing Unusual\" (without quotes) in that line.</p>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<p>1\u2264N\u2264100000</p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n6\nA 100\nB 100\nA 100\nC 50\nD 49\nD 51\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n100\n100\n50\n49 51\nNothing Unusual\n</pre>\n<h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p>Note that no student gave exam E, so nothing unusual in this case.</p>\n",
