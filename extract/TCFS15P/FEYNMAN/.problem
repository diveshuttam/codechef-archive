The plant has <b> N </b> chambers and <b> M </b> valves, each valve connects two chambers. The valves are <b> bidirectional </b>, i.e., substance can flow in either direction through the valve. <br /></p>\n<p>Substance is manufactured in chamber 1 and flows to chamber N, where is exits the plant. <br /></p>\n<p>Due to it's explosive nature, the substance should not be allowed to accumulate. Hence the plant has the property that failure of a single valve cannot prevent substance flow from chamber 1 to chamber N. (Failure of a valve means that substance cannot flow in either direction through that valve). <br /></p>\n<p>Feynman \"accidentally\" found a valve that violated the condition mentioned above. Can you? <br /><br />\n<br /><br />\nINPUT : <br /><br />\nFirst line contains an integer T, number of test cases <br /><br />\nEach testcase starts with a line containing two space-separated integers, N and M <br /><br />\nM lines follow, each containing two space-separated integers A and B, indicating that there is a valve from chamber A to chamber B. <br /></p>\n<p>Assume that it is possible for substance to flow from any chamber to any other in the input. <br /><br />\n<br /><br />\nOUTPUT : <br /><br />\nFor each testcase, print the <b>total number of valves</b> which violate the mentioned condition. <br /><br />\n<br /><br />\nSAMPLE INPUT : <br /><br />\n1 <br /><br />\n4 3 <br /><br />\n1 2 <br /><br />\n2 3 <br /><br />\n3 4 <br /><br />\n<br /><br />\nSAMPLE OUTPUT : <br /><br />\n3 <br /><br />\n<br /><br />\nCONSTRAINTS : <br /><br />\n1 &lt;= T &lt;= 10 <br /><br />\n1 &lt;= N &lt;= 100000 <br /><br />\n1 &lt;= M &lt;= 200000</p>\n",
