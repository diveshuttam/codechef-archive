Each student has told his choice for pop night, which he/ she wants  and one he/she doesn\u2019t want; of course they all understand that since there is only going to be one singer, no one is likely to have all their requirements satisfied. Can you call a singer that will satisfy at least one request from all your friends?\n <br />\nInput Code\tTeacher <br />\nA. \tHoney Singh<br />\nB. \tAtif Aslam<br />\nC. \tMika<br />\nD. \tAnnu Malik<br />\nE. \tShreya Ghoshal<br />\nF. \tMohit chauhan<br />\nG. \tDaler mehndi<br />\nH. \tMoulvi<br />\nI. \tSaleem<br />\nJ. \tSonu Nigam<br />\nK. \tAbheejet Sawant<br />\nL. \tSudesh Bhosle<br />\nM.\tBryan Adams<br />\nN. \tKhelash Kher<br />\nO. \tAlisha<br />\nP. \tShakira<br />\n \nYour friends provide you with a line of text that describes their preferences. For example, the line\n+O-H+P;\nreveals that someone will accept xyz, Iyer but not abc\n-E-I-D+A+J;\nindicates that someone else will not accept Shreya, Saleem and Annu, but Honey Singh or Sonu Nigam would be accepted\n\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n</p><p>The input consists of a series of constraints.\nA constraint is a list of 1 to 12 students choice lists.Each on a line by itself followed by a period on a line by itself.\nA constraint list is a series of singers requests terminated by a single semicolon.\nA request is a sign character (+/-) and then an uppercase letter from A to P. \n\n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n</p><p>For each constraint, provide a description of a singers that satisfies it. A description is the string \"Singers: \" in columns 1 through 10 and then a series of letters, in alphabetical order, listing the codes for singers possible. So, for listing possible singers as Shreya, Saleem and Annu, you  need to print:\nSingers: EID\nIf no combination of singers can be found which satisfies at least one request of every person, your program should print the string\n\"Sorry\" on a line by itself starting in column 1. \n\n<h3>Example</h3>\n\n<pre>\n<b>Input:</b>\n+A+B+C+D-E-F-G-H; \n-A-B+C+D-E-F+G+H; \n-A+B-C+D-E+F-G+H; \n. \n+A+B+C+D; \n+E+F+F+H; \n+A+B-G; \n+O+J-F; \n+H+I+C; \n+P; \n+O+M+L; \n+M-L+P; \n. \n+A+B+C+D; \n+E+F+F+H; \n+A+B-G; \n+P-O; \n+O+J-F; \n+H+I+C; \n+P; \n+O; \n+O+M+L; \n-O-P; \n+M-L+P; \n.\n\n\n<b>Output:</b>\nSingers: \nSingers: CELP\nSorry \n</pre></p>",
