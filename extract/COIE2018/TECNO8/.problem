They decide to have a get together at place H and starts to drive by their car in order to meet at one place.\nThe direction of motion of each friend is as shown in figure. Bob walk from that path, which passes through centroid of the triangle.\n\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://codechef_shared.s3.amazonaws.com/download/triangle.png\">\n\n<br>\n\n\n\nAndrew have very rigid personality, so he always drive the car at some fix speed V (m/s). Other friends already know his speed. Bob and Catherine do not wants to wait so they manage their speed such that all meet at point H at same time. Each friend know the co-ordinate of all three places.\n\n<br>Input:\n\n- First line of each test case contain speed of Andrew car.<br>\n- Next three line will have two space separated decimal numbers <br>denoting x and y coordinate of Andrew, Bob and Catherine.<br>\n<br>\n\nOutput:<br>\n\nOutput will contain time taken to reach at common point H. <br>(Consider each one start at t=0 sec). \n<br> Up to 3 decimal Places.<br>\n\n<br>\nConstraints :<br>\n- $1 \\leq V \\leq 1000$<br>\n- $2 \\leq x,y \\leq 10^9$<br>\n\nSample Input:<br>\n5<br>\n\n0 0<br>\n\n10 0<br>\n\n0 10<br>\n<br>\nSample Output:<br>\n\t1.000<br>\n\t\n",
