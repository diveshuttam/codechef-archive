He won $N-1$ contests in a team with Surya and one individually. For $N-1$ he need to share prize money with Surya and he can keep $Kth$(0 based indexing) contest's prize for himself(does not need to share with Surya).\nSince Shubham is not good at maths, so he did not distributed the money correctly. Help him to distribute the money correctly.\nIf prizes were fairly distributed print \"fair\", otherwise print the difference.\n\n###Input:\n- The first line contains two space-separated integers denoting the respective values of $N$ (the number of contests won a team) and $K$ (the contest won by Surya only). \n- The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers where each integer $i$ denotes the prize money ,$p[i]$ , of contest $i$  (where $0 \\leq i \\leq N$). \n\n- The third line contains an integer, $S$ , denoting the amount of money that Surya gave to Shubham after Technovation2k18.\n\n###Output:\nIf prizes was fairly distributed paint \"fair\"(i.e. $S_shared - S_actual = 0$), otherwise print the difference($S_shared - S_actual$)\n\n###Constraints \n- $2 \\leq N \\leq 10^5$\n- $0 \\leq K \\le N$\n- $0 \\leq p[i] \\le\u03a3c[i]$\n\n###Sample Input:\n4 1\n\n3 10 2 9\n\n12\n\n###Sample Output:\n5\n",
