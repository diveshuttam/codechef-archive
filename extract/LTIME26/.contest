At CodeChef, we work hard to revive the geek in you by hosting a programming contest at the start of the month and another smaller programming challenge in the middle of the month.</p> </div> <p><br /><b class=\"rules-heading\">About CodeChef July LunchTime:</b></p> <div class=\"rules-body\"> <p>CodeChef LunchTime is the Junior Programming series aimed at providing a fun contest to the students of middle/high school. It's a 3 hour, IOI style coding contest where you can show off your computer programming skills. LunchTime contests are the right platform to compete for those who are aspiring to crack\u00a0<b>International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI)</b>.</p> </div> <p><br /><b class=\"rules-heading\">Contest Details:</b></p> <div class=\"rules-body\"> <ul class=\"\"> <li><b>Duration: </b>3 hours </li> <li><b>Start time:</b> From\u00a0<span>July 26th, 2015</span> 11:00 hrs IST.\u00a0<span>Check your time zone </span><a target=\"_self\" href=\"http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=CodeChef%3A+July+Lunchtime+2015&amp;iso=20150726T11&amp;p1=44&amp;ah=3\">here</a><span>.</span></li> <li><span><b>Ends Time:</b> </span><span>July 26th, 2015</span><span> 14:00 hrs IST</span></li> <li><b>For ranklist visit: </b><a href=\"/rankings/LTIME26\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.codechef.com/rankings/LTIME26</a></li> </ul> </div> <p><b class=\"rules-heading\">Eligibility Criteria: Anyone with a knack for Programming :P</b></p> <div class=\"rules-body\"> <p>Our contests are open to all the programmers across the globe.</p> </div> <p>\u00a0</p> <p><b class=\"rules-heading\">What's in it for you?</b></p> <div class=\"rules-body\"> <p>The idea behind these programming contests is that we want you to learn while competing. The dividing line may seem to be thin but it can be captured by the spirit of learning. If whatever you are doing is making you learn while you do so, we tend to believe that it is alright. However, all the participants are expected to abide to\u00a0<a href=\"http://discuss.codechef.com/questions/18662/does-codechef-have-any-code-of-conduct\">CodeChef Code Of Conduct</a>.</p> <br /> <p>Not just that, as a token of motivation we also give away goodies to the winners (only to school students) of the contest. You can know more about prizes\u00a0<a href=\"http://discuss.codechef.com/questions/51999/how-do-i-win-a-codechef-goodie\">here</a>.
