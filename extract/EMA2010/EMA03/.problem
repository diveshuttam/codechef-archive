But since in the world, it will be very difficult with those decimals to purchase things so simply bank rounds off the values. As the institute has foreign collaboration with universities, so in a faculty exchange program if a teacher goes to Japan, then he could exchange BUEST coins with yen. Suppose you have one BUEST coin . What is the maximum amount of yen you can get to survive in Japan.\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The input will contain several test cases . Each test case is a single line with a number n.\nIt is the number written on your coin\n\n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>For each test case output the single line , containing the maximum amount of Japanese Yen a teacher can make.\n\n<h3>Example</h3>\n\n<pre>\n<b>Input:</b>\n12\n2\n\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n13\n2\n</pre>\n",
