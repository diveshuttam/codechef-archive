A student can work on a single project, either alone or with a partner (group of 2). The teacher is okay with any number of pairs or sole workers.</p>\n<p>The teacher is curious to know that how many possible ways can <b>N</b> students form pairs or stay solo. Can you help?</p>\n<p>Note: Since the answer can be large, print it modulo 10<sup>9</sup>+7</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The first line of the input contains an integer <b>T</b> denoting the number of test cases. The description of <b>T</b> test cases follows.</p>\n<p>Each test case consists of a single integer <b>N</b> which denotes the number of students</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>For each test case, output a single line containing the number of ways in which <b>N</b> different persons can make their pairs or stay single. As answer can be large so print it modulo 10<sup>9</sup>+7</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>T</b> \u2264 <b>10<sup>5</sup></b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>N</b> \u2264 <b>10<sup>6</sup></b></li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n2\n2\n3\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n2\n4\n</pre>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p>In first test case , For N=2 answer will be 2. Possible ways are : {1},{2} (It means Student 1 and Student 2 are solo) {1,2} (It means Student 1 and Student 2 had formed a pair)</p>\n<p>For second test case , For N=3 , answer will be 4. Possible ways are : {1},{2},{3} (It means all three Students are solo) {1,2},{3} (It means Student 1 and Student 2 had formed a pair and Student 3 is solo) {1},{2,3} (It means Student 2 and Student 3 had formed a pair and Student 1 is solo) {1,3},{2} (It means Student 1 and Student 3 had formed a pair and Student 2 is solo)\n</p>",
