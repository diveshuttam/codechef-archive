He is not very interested in studies but wants to get a good overall CPI. However, every subject has a different weightage/credit. The credit (denoted as $C$<sub>i</sub>) of a particular course is equal to the position in which it appears in the subject list, i.e, the first course has a credit=1, the second course has a credit=2, and so on.\nNaruto knows his capabilities, and so he has come up with the scores ($S$<sub>i</sub>)  he can achieve in every course. He wants to maximise his CPI, which can be calculated as the weighted mean of all the subjects taken, denoted as\n__Sum(C<sub>i</sub>*S<sub>i</sub>)/Sum(C<sub>i</sub>)__ for all i s.t Naruto has taken up course i\n\n###Input:\n\n- First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. \n- First line of every test case contains two integers, $N$ and $X$\n- Next line of the test case contains $N$ space separated integers S<sub>i</sub>, denoting the score he can get in every subject\n\n###Output:\nFor each testcase, output in a single line the maximum cpi he can get after choosing the subjects. Your output will be considered correct if it has an absolute error of less than 10<sup>-6</sup>.\n\n###Constraints \n- $1 \\leq T \\leq 10$\n- $1 \\leq N \\leq 1000$\n- $1 \\leq X \\leq N$\n- $1 \\leq S$<sub>i</sub>$   \\leq 10000$\n\n###Sample Input:\n1  \n5 2  \n50 40 30 20 10  \n\n\n###Sample Output:\n43.3333333333\n\n\t\n###Explanation:\nHe can achieve the max credit by picking the first two subjects, which produces a CPI of (50 * 1+40 * 2)/(1+2) = 43.333333333",
