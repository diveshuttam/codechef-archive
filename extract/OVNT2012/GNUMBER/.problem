One fine day, when Matt's little brother Paul, was at his math lesson with plastic number toys i.e. plastic toys in shape of digits 0 to 9, Matt and Jeff decided to play a game.<br />\nPaul had left the plastic numbers arranged to form a number <b>N</b>. <br />The rules of the game were as follows:<br /></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The first player has to rearrange the digits to form a larger number than the current number, after that the game will be played turn-wise.</li>\n<li>After the first turn, each player has to rearrange the digits so that it is smaller than the current number in that turn and greater than the original number <b>N</b>.</li>\n<li>\nThe player loses if he cannot arrange a number.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br /><br />\nWhat number should the first player form, so that he always wins?</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>An integer T (1 \u2264 T \u2264 100) denoting number of test cases followed by T lines each containing an  integer N, the number Paul has formed. The number of digit in N is D(1 \u2264 D \u2264 100000).</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>\nFor each test case, output a number which first player should form so that he wins, in a separate line.<br />If there is no winning strategy for first player, then output -1. </p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre>\n<b>Input:</b>\n3\n17\n81\n123\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n71\n-1\n132\n</pre>",
