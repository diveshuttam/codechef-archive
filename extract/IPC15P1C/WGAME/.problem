As you might know, in this game both players take turns in naming a country starting with the same letter as the ending letter of the last country named by the other player. Only their game is slightly different. </p>\n<p>In this game, there is a shared list of words (not necessarily a country), and both players can only pick from words listed here.  To begin, Alex selects a word from the first <b>K</b> words listed in the array. Let's say he selects word <b>a[i]</b>. Then Bob selects a word from the next <b>K</b> entries in the array (ie. having index <b>between i+1 and i+K inclusive</b>) such that Bob's word has the same starting letter as the last letter of word <b>a[i]</b>. The game continues in this manner. If at any point, a person cannot select any country, he loses.</p>\n<p>Given the list of words<b>A[]</b>, and integer <b>K</b>, your task is to tell who will win the game?\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The first line of each test file contains a single integer <b>T</b>, the number of test cases. Then follow the <b>T</b> test cases.</p>\n<p>The first line of every test case contains two integers <b>N</b> and <b>K</b>. Then <b>N</b> lines follow, where the i<sup>th</sup> line contains the word a[i]. The words contain only lowercase English alphabets.</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>For each test case, print a single line containing the name of the player who will win the game, assuming both players play optimally.</p>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b>1</b> &lt;= <b>T</b> &lt;= <b>10 </b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> &lt;= <b>N</b> &lt;= <b>10<sup>^</sup>5</b></li>\n<li><b> Length of word |a[i]| </b> &lt;= <b>10</b> </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n1\n3 2\nindian\nprogramming\ncommunity\n\n<b>Output:</b>\nAlex\n</pre><p>\u00a0</p>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n1\n6 3\nwelcome\nto\nteam\nenigma\nonline\nmagic\n\n<b>Output:</b>\nBob\n</pre><p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p><b>Example case 1.</b> To begin, Alex can select either <b>indian</b> or <b>programming</b>. In either case, Bob can not continue the game and therefore loses the game.</p>\n<p><b>Example case 2.</b> To begin, Alex can select either <b>welcome</b>, <b>to</b> or <b>team</b>. In his turn, depending on what Alex picks, Bob can choose the word <b>enigma</b>, <b>online</b> or <b>magic</b> respectively. Alex will be left with no option after this. Bob will thus win the game.</p>\n",
