After having solved the problem \"String Swap\" easily, he asked for a harder problem to be given to him. \"String Swap\" was thus modified to form the following problem.</p>\n<p>In this problem, you are given a string of <b>N</b> characters(1-indexed), and an integer <b>D</b>.<b>(D is always an even integer)</b>. We perform multiple operations on this string. In every operation, we perform 2 steps.</p>\n<p>In the first operation we select the first <b>D</b> characters of the string, ie. the substring <b>S[1...D]</b> and modify this substring by applying the following two steps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>In the first step, we separate the substring into two equal halves <b>S[1...(D/2)]</b> and <b>S[(D/2 + 1).....D]</b>. These two halves are then interleaved among each other to form the following string:</p>\n<p>S<sub>1</sub>S<sub>D/2+1</sub>S<sub>2</sub>S<sub>D/2+2</sub>....S<sub>D/2</sub>S<sub>D</sub></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In the second step, we perform a <b>K-right circular shift</b> on the substring obtained after step 1. Thus, if the substring at the end of step 1 is <b>abcde</b>, performing a 2-right circular shift on this will change it to <b>deabc</b>.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><b>Note that both these steps are performed on the D-length substring only. All other characters of the main string remain unchanged.</b></p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>The original string is then thrown away, and the new string thus obtained will be used for the subsequent operations.</p>\n<p>In the next operation, we select the next <b>D</b> characters, ie the substring <b>S[2...D]</b> of the current string and perform the same two steps as described above. This constitutes the second operation. We continue performing these operation a total of <b>N-D+1</b> times (selecting substring <b>S[i....(i+D-1)]</b> in the <b>i<sup<br />\n<th</sup></th</sup></sup<br></b> operation. </p>\n<p>Bob was asked to tell the string at the end of all these operations have been performed. This problem however proved to be a tad too difficult for Bob. Can you help him?</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The first line of the input contains a single integer <b>T</b>, the number of test cases.The description of <b>T</b> test cases follows.</p>\n<p>Every test case has two lines. The first line contains the string S. The next line contains two space separated integers <b>D</b> and <b>K</b> corresponding to that test case.</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>For each test case output a single line, containing the value oft the string at the end.</p>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>T</b> \u2264 <b>10</b></li>\n<li><b>2</b> \u2264 <b>|S|</b> \u2264 <b>10<sup>5</sup></b></li>\n<li><b>2</b> \u2264 <b>D</b> \u2264 <b>|S|</b></li>\n<li><b>0</b> \u2264 <b>K</b> &lt; <b>D</b></li>\n<li><b>D is guaranteed to be even</b></li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n1\nhello\n4 2\n\n<b>Output:</b>\neholl\n</pre><p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Explanation</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>After the first operation, in first step, the string <b><u>hell</u></b>o becomes <b><u>hlel</u></b>o. And in second step, it becomes, <b><u>elhl</u></b>o </li>\n<li>After the second operation, in the first step the string becomes e<b><u>llho</u></b> and in second step it becomes e<b><u>holl</u></b>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>Thus the answer is <b>eholl</b>.</p>\n",
