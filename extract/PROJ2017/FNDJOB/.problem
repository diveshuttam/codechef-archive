However, Chandler is faced with some unfortunate circumstances. He is out of a job! (Well sarcasm doesn\u2019t really pay :p) Now after days of hard-work, he is tired of looking for a job. So, he decides to visit Ross\u2019 for entertainment (life is an irony, I know). Just as he entered Ross\u2019 home, he saw a tree with N nodes denoted by numbers from <b>1</b> to <b>N</b>. Node number <b>1</b> has a toy dinosaur. (What else did you expect?)</p>\n\n<p>\nNow, Ross in his ever so enthusiastic voice cried out \u201cI thought of a new game! But you will need to put this blindfold on.\u201d Chandler was not so amused (knowing Ross very well). Ross narrated the rules of the game as follows:\n\n<ul>\n<li> In the first step, Chandler picks a node and crosses it.\n\n<li>In the second step, Ross moves his toy dinosaur from the previous position P to an uncrossed neighbour of P.\n\n<li> In the third step, Ross crosses node P.\n\n</ul>\n</p>\n<p>\nThe above three steps are repeated until Ross can\u2019t make a move. Careful readers must have noticed that Chandler is blindfolded and doesn\u2019t know where Ross has put the toy dinosaur. All he knows is the outline of the tree and the initial position of the dinosaur.</p>\n\n<p>\nChandler is worried about his image and thinks that if anyone sees him playing the game, everything will be lost. Monica is on her way to Ross\u2019 home, so Chandler needs to finish fast. Now he wants to know, whether is it possible to play in such a way that with his limited information he can end the game in at most <b>K</b> moves irrespective of the moves Ross makes. Simply put, he wants Ross to move the dinosaur less than K times. But you know Chandler, sarcasm is his thing, not programming. So he seeks your help and wants  you to write a program that takes the tree as an input and the number <b>K</b> and tells whether Chandler\u2019s task is possible or not?\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<hr>\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>\nThe first line contains two space separated integers, <b>N</b> and <b>K</b> denoting the number of nodes in tree and <b>K</b> as defined above.</p>\n<p>The following <b>N - 1</b> lines contain two integers <b>X</b> and <b>Y</b> denoting that there is an edge between <b>X</b> and <b>Y</b>. It is guaranteed that it a tree.\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<hr>\n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>Output a single word in a line - \u201cYes\u201d if it is possible  for Chandler to complete the game in less than k moves, and otherwise \u201cNo\u201d.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<hr>\n\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>N, K</b> \u2264 <b> 400 </b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>X, Y</b> \u2264 <b> N </b></li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<hr>\n\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input 1:</b>\n3 1\n1 2\n1 3\n\n\n<b>Output 1:</b>\nNo <br>\n\n<b>Input 2:</b>\n6 2\n1 2\n2 3\n3 4\n1 5\n5 6 \n\n\n<b>Output 2:</b>\nYes <br>\n\n</pre>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<hr>\n\n\n<h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p><b>Example case 1: </b> If Chandler crosses node 2, Ross will move to Node 3. If Chandler crosses node 3. Ross will move to Node 2.</p>\n\n<p><b>Example case 2: </b> If Chandler crosses Node 2, Ross will have to move to Node 5. Chandler will then cross Node 6. If Chandler initially crosses Node 5, Ross will move to Node 2 and Chandler will then cross Node 3. </p> ",
