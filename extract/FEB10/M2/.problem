Johnny is watching the race. At the present moment (time 0), Johnny has taken note of the current velocity and position of each motorcyclist.</p>\n<p>Johnny wants to know at a given point of time, which motorcyclist is in a specific place in the rank list. Please help him!</p>\n<p>If at any given time two motorcyclists are in same position, the motorcyclist with the smaller index will be placed before the one with the larger index.</p>\n<p>To make the problem simple, Johnny assumes that each motorcyclist is moving at a constant velocity.</p>\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The first line contains a number t (about 10) which is the number of test cases. Then t test cases follow. Each test case has the following form.</p>\n<p>The first line of the test case contains a number N (1 <= N <= 2000), the number of motorcyclists.</p>\n<p>The i-th line in the next N lines contains two numbers, v and x, which are the velocity and the current position of the i-th motorcyclist (1 <= v, x <= 100,000).</p>\n<p>The next line contains a number Q (1 <= Q <= 2000), the number of time queries.</p>\n<p>Each line in the next Q lines contains two numbers, t (1 <= t <= 1,000,000,000) and k (1 <= k <= n), representing the query: \"at time t, which motorcyclist is positioned k-th in the rank list?\"</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>For each test case, print Q lines, with each line containing the index of the motorcyclist for the corresponding query.</p>\n<p>Remember to print a new line after each test case.</p>\n\n<h3>Example</h3>\n\n<pre>\n<b>Input:</b>\n1\n4\n2 100\n3 50\n4 60\n5 1\n4\n1 1\n50 2\n60 4\n100 1\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n1\n4\n1\n4\n</pre>\n",
