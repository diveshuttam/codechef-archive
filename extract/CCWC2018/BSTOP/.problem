In\nfact, since the management has made sure that it\u2019s possible to travel between any pair of tourist spot,\nthere is a unique set of buses a passenger has to take in order to travel between a particular pair of tourist spots.<br><br></p>\n<p>\nNow, after so many years the management thinks of changing the route plan. \nThey want to remove a bus and replace it with another one so as to minimize <b>X</b> , where <b>X</b> is the maximum number of buses one has to change in order to travel between any pair of tourist spots.\nYou were given the job to remove a bus and replace it with another ,subject to above condition.<br>\nPrint the maximum number of buses one has to change in order to travel between any pair of tourist spot after the buses have been replaced.<br>\n</p>\n\n\t\n\n</p>\n\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>The first line of the input contains an integer <b>N</b> denoting the number of tourist spots . \n<li>Next <b>N\u2009-\u20091</b> lines contain two space separated integers <b>u</b> and <b>v</b>, denoting a bus operating between the spots u and v . \n</li>\n<li> Input is provided in such a way that, it will always be possible to construct better route plan.</li> \n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>For each test case, output the minimum value of <b>X</b><br>\n\n</p>\n<p></p>\n<p> </p>\n\n\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<p></p>\n<ul>\n\n<li><b>4</b> \u2264 <b>N</b> \u2264 <b>2500</b>\n</li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>u,w</b> \u2264 <b>N</b>\n</li>\n<li><b>u</b> != <b>v</b> \n</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p> </p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n<br>\n4<br>\n1 2<br>\n3 4<br>\n2 3<br>\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n<br>2\n\n</pre>\n\n\n<p> </p>\n<h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p>\nRemove a bus operating between spot  1 and spot 2 and add a bus between spot 3 and spot 1.<br>\nNow, to travel between any pair of tourist spot, one has to change maximum 2 buses.<br>\n</p>",
