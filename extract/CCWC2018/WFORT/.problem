It uses a spinning wheel with exactly <b>N</b> numbered pockets and a coin is placed in between every consecutive pocket. The wheel is spun in either of the two ways.\nBefore the wheel is turned, all the coins are restored and players bet on a number <b>K</b>.\nThen a needle is made to point to any one of the pocket which has number K written on it.\nWheel is then spun till the needle encounters number <b>K</b> again and the player gets all the coins the needle has encountered.<br></p><p><br>Shivam being the owner of the gambling house, has the authority to place the needle on any of the <b>K</b> numbered pockets and also he could rotate the wheel in either of the two ways.<br> Shivam has to figure out a way to minimize number of coins that he has to spend on every given bet.</p>\nYou are given a wheel having <b>N</b> elements and <b>Q</b> players. Each player bets on a number <b>K</b> from the wheel. For each player you have to print minimum number of coins Shivam has to spend.\n\n</p>\n\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>The first line of the input contains an integer <b>T</b> denoting the number of test cases .
