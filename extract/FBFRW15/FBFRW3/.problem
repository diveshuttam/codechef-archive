Coincidentally, her best friend was also born on the same day. As a result, she has started liking 9's and 5's a lot. She tries to include it in everything she does. Her email-id has those 2 numbers. Even all the digits of her mobile number are either 9 of 5. She gets her roll number changed if the digits are anything other than 9 and 5. Clearly, she is obsessed with 9's and 5's. Given any number N, she wants to find her next smallest favourite number M greater than N. She is also a bit lazy. Help her in finding M.\n</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>First line of the input will consist of <b>T</b>, the number of test cases. Each of the next <b>T</b> lines contains a single number <b>N</b>.\n</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>For each test case print Swapanti's next favourite number M, in a new line.</p>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>T</b> \u2264 <b>1000</b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>N</b> \u2264 <b>10<sup>99</sup></b></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n4\n8\n58\n240\n69\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n9\n59\n555\n95\n</pre>",
