The three vertices are said to be roughly in Miami, Puerto Rico, island of Bermuda. Chef and his friend Gary visit Miami and there Gary borrows Chef's code book.<br />After spending sometime in the Miami beach both of them engage in an argument over the Bermuda triangle. Gary denies the existence of any such triangle whereas Chef still believes its existence. In order to prove chef wrong, Gary tried to travel in to the Bermuda triangle. But later he found some sort of mysterious behaviour in his travel.<br /> Scared, Gary returned back to Chef accepting that he was wrong. But soon Gary noticed that the code book that Chef had give to him was missing. It fell off the boat somewhere near the area that comes outside the Bermuda triangle but inside the circumcircle of the Bermuda triangle. So, now Chef and his friend Gary travel the<br />\narea to find the book. Your job is to find the total area of Gary's search.<br /><br /></p>\n<p><b>NOTE: Gary couldn't travel inside Bermuda triangle.</b></p>\n<p><b>NOTE: The output should be rounded up to 2 decimal points.</b></p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The first line of the input contains an integer <b>T</b> denoting the number of test cases.
