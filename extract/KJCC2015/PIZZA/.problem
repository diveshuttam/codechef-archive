He needs to get these pizzas delivered before they get cold but he is extremely lazy. He has to deliver pizzas to N houses. You need to tell him which will be the fastest way between 2 houses. You are provided with the name of the person who ordered the pizza (who happens to own the house) and the connection between the houses in terms of time taken to reach from one house to another and you have to find the path which will take least time between a pair of houses.</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>Assume that the total time of a particular path (which is the sum of time of all direct connections belonging to this path) is at most 200000.</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The first line of the input contains an integer <b>T</b> denoting the number of test cases. The description of <b>T</b> test cases follows.</li>\n<li>The first line of every test case is <b>N</b>, the number of houses Krumanal has to deliver pizza to.

So the neighbours and the time taken to go from one house to another are as follows:<br /><br />\ngryffindor-slytherin 5<br />gryffindor-ravenclaw 7<br />slytherin-hufflepuff 1<br />ravenclaw-hufflepuff 4<br /><br />Now, we have to find the minimum time required to go from the mentioned houses. So to go from gryffindor to hufflepuff, we have 2 routes. Via slytherin and via ravenclaw which will take us 6 and 11 units of time respectively. But the route via slytherin takes less time. Hence, the answer is 6.</p>\n",
