Smit, the elder brother has bought a box of <b>N</b> water guns each of distinct cost for his family. Each water gun has its cost printed on it. He keeps the guns randomly on a table, all aligned together. Smit is given the task to sort the guns according to their cost in ascending order. But he is too lazy to do his work. He instead challenges his brother, Vatsal for some chocolates. During the sorting process, Vatsal is only allowed to interchange the places of two guns at a time. For each interchange Vatsal has to give chocolates equal to the sum of the costs of the two guns involved, to Smit.<br /><br />\nHelp Vatsal to determine the minimum number of chocolates he will have to give to sort the sequence of guns on the table.<br />\n</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The input file contains several test cases. Each test case consists of two lines.</li>\n<li>The first contains a single integer <b>N</b> representing the number of water guns on the table.\n</li><li>The second line contains <b>N</b> different integers which are the costs of guns to be sorted.</li>\n<li>The input is terminated by a zero on a line by itself.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>For each test case,output  the minimum number of chocolates required for sorting the guns according to their costs. Output each answer on a new line.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>N</b> \u2264 <b>100</b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>Cost of a gun</b> &lt; <b>1000</b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>Total Number of Test Cases</b> \u2264 <b>30</b></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n3\n4 3 2\n3\n4 2 3\n3\n3 2 1 \n4\n18 11 12 14\n0\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n6\n11\n4\n77\n</pre><h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p><b>Example Case 1:</b> Input (4, 3, 2).
