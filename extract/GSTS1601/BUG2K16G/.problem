He especially enjoys watching the <b>'Skipping Stones'</b> segment of the show. He has created a similar game that has players cross a river by skipping on stones. Now here's the catch, a player can only step onto a stone if that particular stone can support his/her weight. Also its given that the first and the last stone will always have sufficient weight to hold the weight of player. </p>\n<p>For a given scenario, the player would only know which stones would hold his/her weight and the paths through which he/she can travel. So, tell us, whether the player can cross the river. <b>YES</b> or  <b>NO</b>!\n<br>\n<h3>INPUT</h3>\n<p>The first line of the input contains an integer <b>T</b>, denoting the number of test cases. \nThe first line of test case consists of number of stones - <b>N</b>,  number of paths - <b>E</b>, weight of the player - <b>W<sub>t</sub></b>.<br>\nNext line consists of <b>N</b> spaced integers which denotes the weight of stones 1,2,..N.<br> \nNext <b>E</b> lines consists of path of one stone to another stone, through which player can travel!<br>\n</p>\n<br>\n<h3>OUTPUT</h3>\n<p>For each test case, output a single line in format Case #<b>T</b>: <em>answer</em>, where <em>answer</em> will be YES or NO, that is if player can cross or not respectively!</p>\n<br>\n<h3>CONSTRAINTS</h3>\n<p>\n1 < <b>T</b> < 10<br>\n5 <= <b>N, E</b> <= 10<br>\n10 <= <b>W<sub>t</sub> , W<sub>i</sub></b> <= 50<br>\n</p>\n<br>\n<h3>EXAMPLE</h3>\n<p>\n<b>Input:</b><br>\n2<br>\n5 5 20<br>\n20 30 10 40 20<br>\n1 2<br>\n1 3<br>\n2 4<br>\n3 4<br>\n4 5<br>\n3 2 10<br>\n10 9 10<br>\n1 2<br>\n2 3<br>\n<br>\n<b>Output:</b><br>\nCase #1: YES<br>\nCase #2: NO<br>\n<br>\n<p><b>EXPLAINATION:</b> In first test case, player can travel from 1->2->4->5, whereas, in second test case, he cannot travel as in path 1->2->3, 2nd stone cannot handle the weight of player</p>.<br>\n",
