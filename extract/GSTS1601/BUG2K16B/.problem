Chef has expertise in web development and hence is a regular contributor on a forum. Chef sometimes makes multiple contributions in a single day.. Each day chef makes at least 1 contribution he is assigned a shade of green. The greater the number of contribution in a single day the darker shade of green he gets assigned and vice versa. Your job is to find out the number of days chef is assigned a same shade of green and print the number of times chef is assigned a unique shade of green.</p>\n<br>\n<h3>INPUT</h3>\n<p>The first line of input contains an integer <b>T</b> denoting the number of test cases. <b>T</b> test cases follow.<br>\nThe first line of each test case contains an integer <b>N</b> denoting the number of days chef has contributed towards the forum.<br>\nThe next line contains <b>N</b> spaced integers the number of contributions chef has made if he has made any.</p>\n</p>\n<br>\n<h3>OUTPUT</h3>\n<p> \nThe output will contain numbers on separate lines that show the number of individual green shades chef has earned in ascending order of intensity of the shades of green.\n</p>\n<br>\n<h3>CONSTRAINTS</h3>\n<p>1 <= <b>T</b> <= 25<br>\n5 <= <b>N</b> <= 50<br>\n1 <= <b>A<sub>i</sub></b> <= 50<br>\n</p>\n<br>\n<h3>EXAMPLE</h3>\n<b>Input:</b><br>\n1<br>\n7<br>\n20 6 5 3 3 1 1<br>\n<b>Output:</b><br>\n1: 2<br>\n3: 2<br>\n5: 1<br>\n6: 1<br>\n20: 1<br>\n</p>\n<br>",
