He loves Lowest Common Multiple (LCM) too much and he is a very curious guy. He always try to do new things. Now he want to make a large number with it. But he doesn't want to take too many numbers.<br /></p>\n<p>He is willing to take only three numbers less than or equal to N (not necessarily distinct ) and from those three number he want get the maximum number by taking LCM of the numbers.<br /><br /></p>\n<p>As he is busy in playing some more tricks of maths, he assign this task to you.\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>First line of input contains an integer t ( t&lt;=1000 ), Number of test cases.<br />\nt line follows an integer N\n</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>Print t lines contains a single integer \u2014 the maximum possible LCM of three not necessarily distinct positive integers that are not greater than N.</p>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<p>1&lt;= N &lt;= 10^6<br />\n\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n2\n9\n7\n\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n504\n210\n\n</pre><p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p><b>Example case 2.</b> For the last example, we can chose numbers 7, 6, 5 and the LCM of them is 7\u20226\u20225\u2009=\u2009210. It is the maximum value we can get.</p>\n",
