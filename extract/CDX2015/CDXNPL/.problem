In each match, the winner earns 3 points and the<br />\nloser earns no point. There is no draw (if the match is level after the two halves, two teams will take part in a<br />\npenalty shootout to decide the winner).<br /><br /><br />\nAt the end of the league, the winner is the team having the largest number of points. In case there are more than one<br />\nteam which has the largest number of points, these teams will be co-champions of the league.<br /><br /><br />\nThe league has been running for some time. Now, the following problem has arisen: we would like to know if a specific<br />\nteam still has a chance of winning the league.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The first line contains T (about 100), the number of test cases. <BR />Then T test cases follow. Each test case has the<br />\nfollowing form.<BR /><br />\nThe first line of the test case contains a number N (1 &lt;= N &lt;= 100), the number of teams in the league.<BR /><br />\nThe i-th line in the next N lines contains N numbers ai1, ai2, ..., ain. The number aij gives the status of the match<br />\nbetween the i-th team and the j-th team:<BR /><br />\naij = 1 if the i-th team wins,<BR /><br />\naij = 0 if the i-th team loses,<BR /><br />\naij = 2 if the match has not taken place yet.<BR /><br />\nThe input data is such that if i!=j, then aij + aji = 1 or aij = aji = 2. Moreover, aii = 0 for all i.</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>For each test case, print a binary string of length N, in which the i-th character is 1 if the i-th team still has a chance to be a champion of the league, and 0 otherwise.</p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n3\n3\n0 0 0 \n1 0 1 \n1 0 0 \n4\n0 1 1 0 \n0 0 2 0 \n0 2 0 0 \n1 1 1 0 \n5\n0 2 2 1 0 \n2 0 1 1 0 \n2 0 0 1 0 \n0 0 0 0 1 \n1 1 1 0 0 \n\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n010\n0001\n11001\n</pre>",
