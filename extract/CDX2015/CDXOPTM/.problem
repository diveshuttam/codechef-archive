Today she has to go for a date with her boyfriend,<br />\nso she is searching for a particular type of dress which is stored in one of her wardrobes.<br />\nEach wardrobe is of varying capacity and the wardrobes are placed next to one another in a single line . <br /><br /><br />\nFor searching her favorite dress, Shrema has assigned N number of workers.<br />\nShe does not want the workers to come in each others way neither does she want the dress to get intermixed with one another<br />\nso she has decided to partition the total number of ward-robes among the workers and assign a specific set of ward-robes to each worker.<br /><br />\nThe set of ward-robes are made in such a way that each worker has atleast 1 wardrobe to search in.<br /><br /></p>\n<p>Or in other words we can say Shrema wants to divide the wardrobes into N sections (where N is the number of workers) so that every<br />\nwardrobe that the ith worker looks through is earlier in the line than every wardrobe that the jth worker has to look through, for i &lt; j.<br /><br /></p>\n<p>Shrema now has decided to partition the wardrobe so as to minimize the maximum number of dresses that a worker would have to look<br />\nthrough. </p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>\nFirst line of input contains t : no. of test cases. Then t test cases follows:-<br /><br />\nEach test case contain n : Number of wardrobes. Then in the next line :<br />\nN numbers separated by space denoting number of dress in a wardrobe.<br /><br />\nw : Number of workers.</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>Maximum number of dresses that a worker will have to look through to find the dress in an optimal partitioning of the wardrobe..</p>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<p>\n1 &lt;= t &lt;= 1000<br /><br />\n2 &lt;= n &lt;= 1000<br /><br />\nNo of dresses in a wardrobe is not greater than 1000.<br /><br />\n1 &lt;= w &lt;= n\n</p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n3\n9\n10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90\n3\n4\n50 50 50 50\n2\n6\n1 1 1 1000 1 1\n3\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n170\n100\n1000\n</pre><p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p><b>Example case 1.</b> Suppose there were three workers and nine wardrobes with the following number of dress:<br /><br /></p>\n<p>10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90<br /><br /></p>\n<p>She will divide up the wardrobes into the following sections:<br /><br /></p>\n<p>10 20 30 40 50 ||  60 70 || 80 90<br />\n<br /><br /></p>\n<p>The worker assigned to the first section would have to look through 150 dresses.<br /><br />\n The worker assigned to the second section would have to search through 130 dresses, and the last worker would filter through 170 dresses. <br /><br />\nIn this partitioning, the maximum number of dresses that a worker looks through is 170,i.e.,no other partitioning has less than 170 dresses.\n</p>\n",
