Each place is marked with either + or -. The position 1 is always marked +.\n\nThe playing piece is initially placed at 1. The game undergoes in rounds. In each round a single die is thrown which determines the no of paces to move. However the following rules are to be kept in mind.\n\n\n\n1)If the position of the piece is labeled j+ and the dice reads d,such that j+d&lt;=N, then the piece moves forward d steps, otherwise it remains at j.\n\n\n2)If the position of the piece is labelled j- and the dice shows d,such that j-d&gt;=1,then the piece moves backwards d steps, otherwise it remains at j.\n\nFinally the game is decided on the basis of the score which keeps the count of the number of times the piece reaches position 1.\n\n<h3>Input::</h3>\n</p><p>\nThe first line should contain 2 integers specifying the number of positions on board an the number of throws from the die. The next lines contain either + or -, depending on the pattern of the board\n\nThe next lines that follow,contain a single integer d indicating a valid throw such that 1&lt;=d&lt;=6 indicating the move on the die.\n\n<h3>Output:</h3>\n</p><p>\nSingle integer indicating the score\n\n<h3>Sample::</h3>\n<b>input</b>\n12 10\n+\n+\n-\n+\n-\n-\n+\n-\n-\n+\n-\n-\n1\n1\n2\n3\n2\n6\n3\n2\n6\n2\n\n<b>Output</b>\n3</p>",
