Each gymnast has been assigned with a task to perform. Your friend has been given the task to show-off his talent in vertical climbing. For his performance the college has arranged a set of varying height parallel cylinders. \n\nHowever, your friend is a bit lazy. Instead of climbing all the way up, climbing down and then climbing up the next cylinder. He decided to use a shortcut. He would firs climb the first one. If the second one is taller, he would jumb onto it and climb up the remaining height. If the second is smaller, he would climb down to the next pillars height and jump onto it.\n\nYour friend is, however, even more lazy and he would like to minimize the amount of climbing up and down. But he has a limited choice in this matter cause the pillars have been brought. All he can do is arrange them in any order to achieve what he desires.\n\nFor this purpose he turns over to you to device him an application which would input the pillars and their lengths and output the minimum climbing he would be required to perform along with the placement combination of the pillars\n\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The first line should contain an integer N which determines the number of pillars to be used. The next N lines provide information about the heights of the cylinders. \n\n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>The output must consist of N lines each containing one integer. This the minimum distance which is required to be climbed by your friend.\n\n<h3>Example</h3>\n\n<pre>\n<b>Input:</b>\n3\n4\n2\n4\n\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n3\n1\n2\n\n</pre>",
