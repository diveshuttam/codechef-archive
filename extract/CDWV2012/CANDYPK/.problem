One day, while packing candies, he counted number of different ways he can pack candies in a box. Two ways are different if there exists a candy type for which its count in resulting boxes is different. Box has a property that they can contain only a fixed number of candies, neither less nor more.</p>\n<p>If Papa has three types for candies <b>S<sub>1</sub></b>, <b>S<sub>2</sub></b>, <b>S<sub>3</sub></b> and three boxes (<b>B<sub>1</sub></b>, <b>B<sub>2</sub></b>, <b>B<sub>3</sub></b>), and he has to pack 6 candies in each box. Suppose he pack candies in a way that box has configuration <b>B<sub>1</sub></b>{<b>S<sub>1</sub></b> = 1, <b>S<sub>2</sub></b> = 0, <b>S<sub>3</sub></b> = 5},  <b>B<sub>2</sub></b>(<b>S<sub>1</sub></b> = 1, <b>S<sub>2</sub></b><sub> </sub>= 3, <b>S<sub>3</sub></b> = 2) and <b>B<sub>3</sub></b>(<b>S<sub>1</sub></b> = 1, <b>S<sub>2</sub></b> = 0, <b>S<sub>3</sub></b> = 5), then Box B<sub>1</sub> and B<sub>2</sub> are said to have different configuration, while Box B<sub>1</sub> and B<sub>3</sub> are same.</p>\n<p>But wait, there are some candies of which Smurfs are very fond of. So they gave you a list of such candies and the minimum number for each candy they want in their box. If a candy is not in this list, then Papa can pack any number (including zero) of this type of candy. </p>\n<p>Now help Papa in counting different number of ways he can pack candies in a box. Papa has infinite supply of each type of candies.</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>First line of input contain three integers, <b>N M K</b>, number of candies to be packed in a box, number of types of candies Papa had and length of candy's list which Smurfs give to him respectively. Then follow <b>K</b> lines. In each lines there are two integers, <b>S<sub>i</sub> X<sub>i</sub></b>, type of candy and minimum number of candy he has to put in each box (1 \u2264 <b>i</b> \u2264 <b>M</b>).</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>Find number of different ways Papa can pack candies in a box. As this number can be very large print <b>answer modulo 1000000007 (10^9 + 7)</b>.</p>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<p>1 \u2264 <b>N</b> \u2264 1000000</p>\n<p>1 \u2264 <b>M</b> \u2264 1000000</p>\n<p>0 \u2264 <b>K</b> \u2264 <b>M</b></p>\n<p>1 \u2264 <b>S<sub>i</sub></b> \u2264 <b>M</b></p>\n<p>1 \u2264 <b>X<sub>i</sub></b> \u2264 <b>1000000</b></p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre>\n<b>Input #0:</b>\n4 2 1\n1 2\n\n<b>Output #0:</b>\n3\n\n<b>Input #1:</b>\n5 3 2\n1 2\n2 1\n\n<b>Output #1:</b>\n6\n\n<b>Input #2:</b>\n5 1 1\n3 6\n\n<b>Output #2:</b>\n0\n\n</pre><h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p><b>Explanation for Sample Input #0:</b></p>\n<p>Papa has to pack 4 candies in a box, and he has two types of candies (S<sub>1</sub>, S<sub>2</sub>). This particular Smurf has mentioned that the box must have at least 2 candy of candy type #1. Then there are 3 number of ways of packing candies, represented by (S<sub>1</sub> = 2, S<sub>2</sub> = 2), (S<sub>1</sub> = 3, S<sub>2</sub> = 1), (S<sub>1</sub> = 4, S<sub>2</sub> = 0).</p>\n<p><b>Explanation for Sample Input #2:</b></p>\n<p>Papa has to pack 5 candies in a box, while according to list he has to pack at least 6 candies of candy type 3. And it is not possible.</p>\n",
