    "body": "<span class=\"solution-visible-txt\">All submissions for this problem are available.</span><p>Emily is coming back from her two-week vacation at the other continent. But when Emily arrived at the airport, she realized that she had got no presents for her <b>K</b> friends! She still had some time before her flight, so she went for a walk around the airport hoping to find something suitable.\n\n</p><p>Soon Emily found a candy store and decided to buy some of her favorite candies for her friends. The store offers <b>N</b> packs of these candies, where pack <b>i</b> contains <b>A<sub>i</sub></b> candies.\n\n</p><p>Another reason Emily decided to buy candies is that she is fond of collecting empty candy packs from various parts of the world. That's why she decided to buy exactly <b>M</b> packs and present the friends with the candies and keep the packs for her collection. Emily would also like the total number of candies to be divisible by <b>K</b> so that an equal distribution of candies between friends is possible. Among all possible sets of packs, she would like to buy a set with the smallest possible total number of candies (money is the reason).\n\n</p><p>Your task is to help Emily, of course.\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n</p><p>The first line of the input file contains an integer <b>T</b> -- the number of test cases (no more than 5). <b>T</b> test cases follow, and each test case consists of two lines. The first of them contains three integers <b>N</b>, <b>M</b> and <b>K</b> (1 \u2264 <b>M</b> \u2264 <b>N</b> \u2264 50000, 1 \u2264 <b>K</b> \u2264 20). The second of them contains <b>N</b> integers <b>A<sub>i</sub></b> (1 \u2264 <b>A<sub>i</sub></b> \u2264 10<sup>9</sup>).\n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n</p><p>For each test case, output just one line containing the smallest possible total number of bought candies, or <b>-1</b> if it's impossible to buy exactly <b>M</b> packs so that the total number of candies is divisible by <b>K</b>.\n\n<h3>Example</h3>\n\n<pre>\n<b>Input:</b>\n2\n5 3 5\n1 2 3 4 5\n6 3 4\n9 5 1 7 3 7\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n10\n-1\n\n<b>Explanation:</b>\n</pre>\n</p><p>In the first test case, it's impossible to buy one candy per friend as three smallest packs contain 6 candies all together. Two candies per friend is possible though -- for example, if you buy packs with 1, 4 and 5 candies.\n\n</p><p>In the second test case, buying 3 packs implies buying an odd number of candies, which is impossible to distribute equally among 4 friends.</p>",
