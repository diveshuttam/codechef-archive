Initially he and the bucket is at <b>X = 0 </b> , there is a rope on which he can put his clothes for drying. He can put his clothes at positive integer coordinates on the rope and atmost 1 clothe can be put at a point. Also he can carry atmost 1 clothe with him at a time.\n<br>\nChef takes <b>B</b> units of energy to move by <b>1</b> unit in any direction.\nChef also has to option to move to bucket to some  position which takes <b>C[N] *  distance + D</b> energy where <b>N</b> is the number of clothes remaining in the bucket.\n<br>\nNote that you cannot carry the bucket and place some clothes on the rope at the same time<br>\nHelp chef in finding the minimum amount of energy needed to put all clothes on the rope.\n<br>\n<h3> Constraints </h3>\n<br>\n<b>1</b> <= <b>A</b> <= <b>1000</b>\n<br>\n<b>1</b> <= <b>B</b> <= <b>10<sup> 9 </sup> </b>\n<br>\n<b>1</b> <= <b>D</b> <= <b>10<sup> 9 </sup> </b>\n<br>\n<b>1</b> <= <b> C[i] </b> <= <b>10<sup> 9 </sup> </b> for <b> 0 </b> <=<b> i </b> <= <b> A </b>\n<br>\nNote that <b> C[i] </b> might be less then <b>C[i + 1]</b> because he is chef.\n<br>\n<h3> Input Format </h3>\n<br>\nThe only line of input contains 3 integers <b>A</b> , <b>B</b> , <b>D</b>.\nThe next line containts <b>A + 1</b> integers where the i <sup> th </sup> integer denotes the value of <b>C[i - 1]</b>.\n<br>\n\n<h3> Output Format </h3>\n<br>\nPrint the minimum amount of energy needed\n<br>\n<h4> Sample Input </h4>\n<br>\n2 1 0\n<br>\n0 1 2\n<br>\nOutput\n<br>\n3\n<br>\nChef takes the bucket to X = 1 , takes 2 units of energy , then puts a clothe there and then takes another clothe to X = 2 taking 1 more unit of energy so total being 3 units.\n<br>\n<h4>Sample Input</h4>\n<br>\n4 1 0\n<br>\n0 1 2 3 4\n<br>\nOutput\n<br>\n10\n<br>\nChef takes the bucket to X = 1 , puts one clothe there , Takes the bucket to X = 2 and puts one clothe , takes bucket to X = 3 and puts a clothe there and finally takes the bucket to X = 4 and puts a clothe there . total energy being 4 * 1 + 3 * 1 + 2 * 1 + 1 * 1.\n<br>\n<h4>Sample Input </h4>\n<br>\n2 1 1\n<br>\n0 100000000 200000000\n<br>\nOutput\n<br>\n4\n<br>\nChef takes a clothe to 1 and returns to bucket at 0 and takes the clothe to 2 and puts it there.\n<br>\nTotal energy = 1 + 1 + 2 = 4\n<br>\n<h4>Sample Input</h4>\n<br>\n3 4 1\n<br>\n4 2 1 3\n<br>\nOutput\n<br>\n9\n<br>",
