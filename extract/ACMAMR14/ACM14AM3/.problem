An important part of the launch pad is the launch tower. It is the long vertical structure which supports the rocket.</p>\n<p>ISRO now wants to build a better launch pad for their next mission. For this, ISRO has acquired a long steel bar, and the launch tower can be made by cutting a segment from the bar. As part of saving the cost, the bar they have acquired is not homogeneous.<br />\nThe bar is made up of several blocks, where the <b>i<sup>th</sup></b> block has durability <b>S[i]</b>, which is a number between <b>0</b> and <b>9</b>. A segment is defined as any contiguous group of one or more blocks.</p>\n<p>If they cut out a segment of the bar from i<sup>th</sup> block to j<sup>th</sup> block (i&lt;=j), then the durability of the resultant segment is given by <b>( S[i]*10<sup>(j-i)</sup> + S[i+1]*10<sup>(j-i-1)</sup> + S[i+2]*10<sup>(j-i-2)</sup> + &hellip; + S[j] * 10<sup>(0)</sup> ) % M</b>.</p>\n<p>In other words, if <b>W<sub>(i,j)</sub></b> is the base-10 number formed by concatenating the digits <b>S[i], S[i+1], S[i+2], &hellip;, S[j]</b>, then the durability of the segment (i,j) is <b>W<sub>(i,j)</sub> % M</b>.</p>\n\n<p>For technical reasons that ISRO will not disclose, the durability of the segment used for building the launch tower should be exactly <b>L</b>. Given <b>S</b> and <b>M</b>, find the number of ways ISRO can cut out a segment from the steel bar whose durability is <b>L</b>.</p>\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The first line contains a string <b>S</b>. The i<sup>th</sup> character of this string represents the durability of i<sup>th</sup> segment.</p>\n<p>The next line contains a single integer <b>Q</b>, denoting the number of queries.</p>\n<p>Each of the next <b>Q</b> lines contain two space separated integers, denoting <b>M</b> and <b>L</b>.</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>For each query, output the number of ways of cutting the bar on a separate line.</p>\n\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b>1</b> &le; <b>|S|</b> &le; <b>2 * 10^4</b></li>\n<li><b>Q &le; 5</b></li>\n<li><b>0</b> &lt; <b>M</b> &lt; <b>500</b></li>\n<li><b>0</b> &le; <b>L</b> &lt; <b>M</b></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n23128765\n3\n7 2\n9 3\n15 5\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n9\n4\n5\n</pre>\n<h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p>For M=9, L=3, the substrings whose remainder is 3 when divided by 9 are: 3, 31287, 12 and 876.</p>\n",
