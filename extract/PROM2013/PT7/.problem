God, The mastermind has locked them up in separate hallways to test their capability and then possibly give them \u201cknowledge of living\u201d.<br />\nEach hallway contains 100 rocks labeled with the positive integers {1,2,\u2026.,100}, rock k is always k meters from the start of the hallway, and Adam/Eve  both begin at 1. Over the period of one second,  Adam/Eve can walk one meter in either direction, or can destroy the rock at its position. To complete the test, Adam/Eve need to destroy a certain sequence of rocks in a certain order. Both Adam/Eve know the full sequence in advance. How fast can they complete it ?<br />\nFor example, let's consider the following rock sequence: </p>\n<ul>A 2, E 1, E 2, A 4</ul>\n<p>Here, A 2 means rock 2 in Adam's hallway, E 1 means rock 1 in Eve's hallway, and so on. Adam/Eve can destroy this sequence of rocks in 6 seconds using the strategy shown below:</p>\n<ul>Time | Adam             | Eve </ul>\n<ul>-----+------------------+-----------------</ul>\n<ul>1  | Move to rock 2   | Stay at rock 1 </ul>\n<ul> 2  | Destroy rock 2       | Stay at rock 1</ul>\n<ul> 3  | Move to rock 3   | Destroy rock 1</ul>\n<ul> 4  | Move to rock 4   | Move to rock 2</ul>\n<ul> 5  | Stay at rock 4   | Destroy rock 2 </ul>\n<ul>  6  | Destroy rock 4       | Stay at rock 2</ul>\n<p>Note that Eve has to wait until Adam has completely finished Destroying A 2 before she can start Destroying E 1. </p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, T. T test cases follow.<br />\nEach test case consists of a single line beginning with a positive integer N, representing the number of rocks that need to be hit. This is followed by N terms of the form \"Si Pi\" where Si is a super human (always 'A' or 'E'), and Pi is a rock position. </p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>For each test case, output a single integer containing the minimum number of seconds required for Adam and Eve to destroy the given rocks, in order. </p>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<p>Should contain all the constraints on the input data that you may have. Format it like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>T</b> \u2264 <b>100</b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>Pi</b> \u2264 <b>100</b></li>\n</ul>\n",
