Professor Utonium discovered that all the Beebo\u2019s can once again be made into one little Beebo by adding all of them. You have to add the Beebos such as:<br />\nThere are n piles of Beebos of sizes b1,\u2009b2,\u2009...,\u2009bn lying on the floor in front of you.<br />\nDuring one move you can take one pile of Beebo and add it to the other. As you add pile x to pile y, the size of pile y increases by the current size of pile x, and pile x stops existing. The cost of the adding operation equals the size of the added pile.<br />\nYour task is to determine the minimum cost at which you can gather all Beebos in one pile.<br />\nTo add some challenge, the piles of Beebos built up conspiracy and decided that each pile will let you add to it not more than t times (after that it can only be added to another pile).<br />\nMoreover, the piles of Beebos decided to puzzle you completely and told you q variants (not necessarily distinct) of what t might equal.<br />\nYour task is to find the minimum cost for each of q variants.</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The first line of the input contains an integer <b>T</b> denoting the number of test cases. The description of <b>T</b> test cases follows<br />\nThe first line of each test case contains integer n \u2014 the number of piles of Beebos. The second line contains n space-separated integers: b1,\u2009b2,\u2009...,\u2009bn \u2014 the initial sizes of the piles of Beebos.</p>\n<p>The third line contains integer q  -- the number of queries. The last line contains q space-separated integers t1,\u2009t2,\u2009...,\u2009tq -- the values of number t for distinct queries. Note that numbers ti can repeat.</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>Print q whitespace-separated integers -- the answers to the queries in the order, in which the queries are given in the input.</p>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>T</b> \u2264 <b>100</b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>n</b> \u2264 <b>105</b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>bi</b> \u2264 <b>109</b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>q</b> \u2264 <b>105</b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>ti</b> \u2264 <b>105</b></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n1\n5\n2 3 4 1 1\n2\n2 3\n\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n9 8 \n</pre>",
