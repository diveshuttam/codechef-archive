At these parties, they play board games. This Friday, they are playing a game named \"Boats! Boats! Boats!\". In this game players have to transport cookies between Venice and Constantinople. Each player has a personal storage. The players are numbered from 1 to <b>N</b>, Chef is numbered 1. Rules for determining a winner are very difficult, therefore Chef asks you to write a program, which will determine who is a winner. \n</p>\n\n<p>\nThere are 6 types of cookies. For each cookie in the storage player gets 1 point. Also player gets additional points if he packs his cookies in some boxes as follows: \n<ul>\n<li>A box containing 4 different types of cookies fetches 1 additional point.</li>\n<li>A box containing 5 different types of cookies fetches 2 additional points.</li>\n<li>A box containing 6 different types of cookies fetches 4 additional points.</li>\n</ul>\n\nObviously a cookie can be put into a single box.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nFor each player, you know the number of cookies in his storage (denoted by <b>c[i]</b>), also the types of cookies in the storage given denoted by <b>type[i][j]</b>.</p>\n\n<p>\nYour task is to determine the winner of this game. Output \"tie\" if there are two or more players with same maximum score, \"chef\" if only Chef has a maximum score, winner's index in all other cases.</p>\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>\nThe first line of input contains a single integer <b>T</b> denoting the number of test cases. This will be followed by <b>T</b> test cases.</p>\n<p>The first line of each test case contains an integer <b>N</b> denoting the number of players.</p>\n<p>The second line of each test case contains an integer <b>c[i]</b> denoting the number of cookies in the i-th storage, followed by <b>c[i]</b> space-separated integers <b>type[i][j]</b> which denote the type if j-th cookie in the storage i-th.</p>\n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>For each test case, output a single line containing the answer as specified in the statement.</p>\n  \n<h3>Constraints and Subtasks</h3>\n<b>Subtask #1 : (20 points) </b> </br>\n<ul>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>T</b> \u2264 <b>10</b> </li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b> N </b> \u2264 <b>100 </b> </li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b> c[i] </b> \u2264 <b> 100 </b> </li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b> type[i][j] </b> \u2264 <b> 3 </b> </li>\n</ul>  </br>\n\n<b>Subtask #2 : (80 points) </b> </br>\n<ul>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>T</b> \u2264 <b>10</b> </li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b> N </b> \u2264 <b>100 </b> </li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b> c[i] </b> \u2264 <b> 100 </b> </li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b> type[i][j] </b> \u2264 <b> 6 </b> </li>\n</ul> \n\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre>\n<b>Input:</b><tt>\n3\n2\n6 1 2 3 4 5 6\n9 3 3 3 4 4 4 5 5 5\n2\n5 2 3 4 5 6\n7 1 1 2 2 3 3 4\n3\n4 1 1 2 3\n4 1 2 2 3\n4 1 2 3 3\n</tt>\n<b>Output:</b><tt>\nchef\n2\ntie</tt>\n</pre>\n\n<h3>Explanation</h3> \n<p><b>Example case 1</b>.</p>\n<p>Chef has total 6 cookie, so he gets 6 points for that. Also, he can put all his cookies (as they are all distinct) in a bag of size 6. It will fetch him additional 4 points. So, Chef's total points will be 10.</p>\n<p>The second player has 9 cookies, he gets 9 points for that. Other than this, he can't create a bag with either 4, 5 or 6 distinct cookies. So, his final score is 9.</p>\n<p>10 > 9 - Chef wins.</p>\n\n<p><b>Example case 2</b>.</p>\n<p>Chef has 5 + 2 (a bag with 5 different cookies) = 7.</p>\n<p>The second player has 7 + 1(a bag with 4 different cookies) = 8.</p>\n<p>7 < 8 - the second player wins.</p>\n\n<p><b>Example case 3</b>.</p>\n<p>Every player has 4 cookies and can't create any bag of sweets. So, it's a tie.</p>",
