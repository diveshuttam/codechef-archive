Khaleesi knows that the gates of the wall will open in exactly <b><i>K</i></b> minutes, and to enter winterfell she has to reach the wall in at max <b><i>K</i></b> minutes, but, there is a problem. Khaleesi and her dragons cannot stay at one place for too long, so even if she is able to reach the wall for a time a lot less than <b><i>K</i></b> minutes, then she will not make it to winterfell. To be specific, if Khaleesi and her dragon stands at one place for more than <b><i>U</i></b> minutes, they will be captured by the white walkers, though each of them individually can stand at a certain point for any amount of time. Khaleesi has many paths along her way and she knows the time each path will take to help her reach the gates, though she and her dragon cannot travel on the same path at one time. They always travel in two different paths, starting one after the other, and when they finally reach the gate, they can either pass through it and enter Winterfell or be captured by the white walkers, if they together arrive and have to stand for the gates to open for more than <b><i>U</i></b> minutes.</br>\nYou need to help Khaleesi and her dragon find out the perfect pair of paths, which will help them reach the gates before or at max <b><i>K</i></b> minutes, and if they do, you should tell them that they are safe. If they have to wait for more than <b><i>U</i></b> minutes at the gate for every pair of paths available, you should tell that they are unsafe.<br/>\nN.B. : You may consider that the gates closes immediately as they open at <b><i>K</i></b> minutes, and assume the time of start of Khaleesi and her dragon's journey is 0. </br></br>\n\t\n<b>Input Format :</b>\n</br>\n\nThe first line contains T, number of test cases.</br>\nThe test cases are described over T subsequent lines in which, each line contains an integer <b><i>N</i></b>, the number of paths available, an array of integers <b><i>A</i></b>, which are the time taken by each path to the gates, an integer <b><i>K</i></b> and another integer <b><i>U</i></b>.</br></br>\n\n<b>Constraints :</b>\n</br>\n\nT Ranges from [1,100] </br>\n\nN ranges from [0,100000]</br>\n\nA[i] ranges from [0,100000]</br>\n\nK ranges from [0,100000]<br/>\n\nU ranges from [0,100000]<br/><br/>\n\n<b>Output Format :</b>\n</br>\n\nFor each test case print \"Safe\" if Khaleesi and her dragon are able to cross the gates safely in the constraints provided, or print \"Unsafe\" if they would be captured by white walkers. </br></br>\n\n<b>Sample Input :</b>\n</br>\n\nInput 1:</br>\n1</br>\n6</br>10 12 15 3 7 16</br>25 5</br></br>\n\nInput 2:</br>\n1</br>\n4<br/>28 31 14 22<br/>63 3</br></br>\n\n<b>Sample Output :</b>\n</br>\n\nOutput 1:</br>\nSafe</br></br>\n\nOutput 2:</br>\nUnsafe</br></br>\n\n\n<b>Explanation :</b></br>\n\nIn Output 1 - there are two paths with time 10, 15 which will help Khaleesi and her dragon reach the gates in exactly 25 minutes, which is the value of K, thus they will be Safe.</br></br>\n\nIn Output 2 - Khaleesi and her dragon should reach the gates in at max 63 minutes, but they together cannot wait at the same spot for 3 minutes. The best possible pair which will help them reach the gates in the closest time to 63 minutes is by choosing the pair (28,31) giving a combined time of 59 minutes, and thus they have to wait at the gates together for 4 minutes, which is greater than 3 minutes, thus they will be captured by the white walkers, thus they are Unsafe.</br></br>\n</p>",
