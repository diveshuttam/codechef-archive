He have to start from island number 1 and must end on island number <b>n</b>.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n2.He also has a jumping capacity <b>L</b> in the beginning. Suppose he is on the island <b>m</b> and has jumping capacity <b>k</b> on that instance then he can jump from island <b>m</b> to island <b>m + d</b> where <b>d</b> divides <b>k</b> and after this jump his jumping capacity will change to <b>d</b>.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\nAs Jack is a greedy boy he will always have the maximum profit.\n<br/>\nCan you figure out the maximum profit he can collect?\n</p>\n\n<p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\nThe first line contains <b>N, L</b> the number of islands and the jumping capacity in island number 1.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe following line contains N space separated integers <b> A<sub>1</sub>, A<sub>2</sub>, ..., A<sub>n</sub> </b> these are the respective profit or loss in the respective islands.\n\n</p>\n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>Print one integer, the maximum profit Jack can collect.</p>\n<p>Tips:</p>\n\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b>2</b> \u2264 <b>N</b> \u2264 <b>50000</b></li>\n<li><b>2</b> \u2264 <b>L</b> \u2264 <b>50000</b></li>\n<li><b>-10^9</b> \u2264 <b>L</b> \u2264 <b>10^9</b></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n5 4 \n8\n-1\n3\n-1\n3\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n14\n</pre>\n<h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p><b>Example case 1.</b> When you start you have jump capacity of 4 and he starts with a profit of 8. Next he jumps two times and he is on island number 3 with a total profit of 11 and jump capacity of 2, the he jumps two times and he is on island number 5 with total profit 14. This is the maximum he can get. Any other sequence of jumps cannot get him more profit than 14</p>",
