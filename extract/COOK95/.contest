Also we believe that it is alright to refer to tutorials, books and other materials, learn a concept and then apply the same to solve a problem during a contest. But it is <strong>not alright to copy other people's solutions or seek other people's help to solve a problem without understanding it.</strong> The dividing line may seem to be thin but it can be captured by the spirit of learning. If whatever you are doing is making you learn while you do so, we tend to believe that it is alright. However, all the participants are expected to abide to <a class=\"button blue\" href=\"/codeofconduct\">CodeChef Code Of Conduct</a></p>\r\n<p>Not just that, as a token of motivation we also give away goodies to the winners of the contest.</p>\r\n<p><strong>For Indians:</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Top 10 from the Indian ranklist will win CodeChef laddus.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><b>Additional prizes in this Cook-Off (for Div 1)</b><strong>:</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Top 10 from the Indian ranklist will win 75% scholarship for\u00a0<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"/certification/about\">CCDSAP Certification</a>.</li>\r\n<li>Ranks between 11-20 will win 50% scholarship for\u00a0<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"/certification/about\">CCDSAP Certification</a>.</li>\r\n<li>Ranks between 21-30 will win 25% scholarship for\u00a0<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"/certification/about\">CCDSAP Certification</a>.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>For Rest of World:</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Top 10 from ranklist will win CodeChef laddus</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p class=\"last\">With CodeChef laddus, the winners can claim cool CodeChef goodies.
