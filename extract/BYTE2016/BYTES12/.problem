Lets say you are on the 12th block then you can jump either to 10th block ( 2 is prime factor of 12 ) or 9th block (3 is prime factor of 12 ). Your end goal is to reach 0th block with minimum possible time assuming each jump takes 1s .<br />\n<br /><br />\nFor more info on prime numbers check this link : <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number</a><br />\n<br /><br /><br />\nVirat is weak at competitive coding .Help him!!\n</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>Input will contain an integer N denoting the block Virat will be currently on .</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>Minimum time to reach 0th block.</p>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<p>2&lt;=N&lt;=1000000<br />\n<br /></p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n4\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n2</pre>",
