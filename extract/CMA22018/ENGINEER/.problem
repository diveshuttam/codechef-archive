Little did he know, what was ahead of him. At the start of his engineering journey, he has an initial motivation of $Z$ units.\n\nThere are many ups and downs in engineering life. Let's assume the engineering life is divided into $N$ weeks. Each week may or may not have an event associated with it.\n\nThe events can be :\n- Party: represented by $p$ which increases his motivation by 100 units\n- Watching Movie: represented by $m$ which increases his motivation by 50 units\n- Playing Cricket: represented by $c$ which increases his motivation by 200 units\n- Assignments: represented by $a$ which decreases his motivation by 50\n- Internal exams - represented by $i$ which decreases his motivation by 100\n- Externals exams - represented by $e$ which decreases his motivation by 150\n- No event - represented by $0$ (zero)\n\nAlso, the motivation level reduces by 10 every week, irrespective of any event.\n\nYour task is to find out the minimum motivation, Ankush needs to start with ($Z$), such that his motivation level is never negative throughout his journey.\n\n<hr>\n\n\n###Input:\n\n- First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. \n- Each testcase has one line, containing a string in which each character representing a week's event.\n\n<hr>\n\n###Output:\nFor each testcase, output in a single line the value of $Z$, i.e. the minimum non-negative value of initial motivation Ankush needs, such that it never goes negative throughout his journey.\n\n<hr>\n\n###Constraints \n- $1 \\leq T \\leq 50$\n- $1 \\leq$ String Length ($N$) $\\leq 10^5$\n\n<hr>\n\n###Sample Input:\n\n2\n\n0ipme\n\n00pi0e\n\n###Sample Output:\n\n150\n\n210\n\n<hr>\n\t\n###EXPLANATION:\n\nTake motivation level 150 to start with.\n\n- At $0$ motivation level decreases by 10 making it 150-10 = 140.\n- $i$: 140-100 = 40. Also 40-10 = 30.\n- $p$: 30+100 = 130. Also 130-10 = 120.\n- $m$: 120+50 = 170. Also 170-10 = 160.\n- $e$: 160-150 = 10. Also 10-10 = 0.\n\nThus, motivation level of 150 is sufficient for him to survive through his engineering life.",
