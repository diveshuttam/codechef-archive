He also needs to know the number of students in the biggest gang. You being the best programmer in your college are chosen for this task.\n\nA survey was done in your college and any two people found talking a lot, giving hi-fives, sharing lunch, were added to a list. You are provided with the results of this survey.\n\nThe survey has a list of pairs of names. Each pair suggests a mutual friendship. The friendship is also transitive, i.e. if A is friends with B and B is friends with C means A, B & C are all in the same gang, irrespective of whether A and C are friends or not. No member of one gang is friends with any member of another gang.\n\nYour task is to find the number of gangs in your college($N$) and the number of students in the largest gang($Z$).\n\n<hr>\n\n###Input:\n\n- First line will contain $T$, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow. \n- The first line of each test case will contain $P$, number of pairs in the list to follow.\n- Following $P$ lines will each contain two names(only first names) separated by a space, representing a friendship between them.\n\n<hr>\n\n###Output:\nFor each testcase, output in a single line two integers (separated by a space), the total number of gangs and the number of students in the largest gang.\n\n<hr>\n\n###Constraints \n- $1 \\leq T \\leq 10$\n- $1 \\leq P \\leq 100000 (10^5)$\n\n<hr>\n\n###Sample Input:\n\n2\n\n6\n\nDanny Jon\n\nCersi Gregor\n\nVarys Baelish\n\nSansa Arya\n\nJon Sansa\n\nCersi Jaime\n\n2\n\nRoss Rachel\n\nChandler Joey\n\n###Sample Output:\n\n3 4\n\n2 2\n\n<hr>\n\n###EXPLANATION:\n- CASE 1: There are three groups forming, {Danny, Jon, Sansa, Arya,}, {Varys, Baelish}, {Cersi, Jaime, Gregor}.\n\n- CASE 2: There are two groups forming, {Ross, Rachel}, {Chandler, Joey}.",
