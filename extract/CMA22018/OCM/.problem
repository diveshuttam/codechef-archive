But this has got to his head now, and he starts multiplying any two numbers he sees. All his friends are pretty annoyed by this. They decided to feed him with arrays, but not just any arrays.\n\nOnly such arrays, that if harry starts multiplying any two numbers (a number will not be multiplied by itself, though it could be multiplied with its another image if it's present twice or more times in the array) randomly in the whole array, no new number (that is not already present in that array) should be formed.\n\nYou have a lot of arrays and your task is to find out if an array is OK to be given to Harry.\n\n<hr>\n\n###Input:\n\n- First line will contain $N$, number of arrays you'll be given.\n- For each array, there'll be two lines of input\n    - First line will contain a single integer $X$, size of the array.\n    - Second line will contain the array, i.e. $X$ space separated integers.\n\n<hr>\n\n###Output:\nFor each array, output a single line answer, whether the array is OK to be given to Harry or not? \"OK\" or \"NOT OK\" (without quotes)\n\n<hr>\n\n###Constraints \n- $1 \\leq N \\leq 100$\n- $1 \\leq X \\leq 10^4$\n\n- $-10^9 \\leq $each element in the array$ \\leq 10^9$\n\n<hr>\n\n###Sample Input:\n4\n\n3\n\n2 1 0\n\n4\n\n1 -1 2 -2\n\n3\n\n1 1 1\n\n1\n\n8\n\n###Sample Output:\n\nOK\n\nNOT OK\n\nOK\n\nOK\n\n<hr>\n\t\n###EXPLANATION:\nNo new numbers are formed in the 1st, 3rd and 4th array. But in 2nd array (-4) can be formed by multiplying (-2*2).\n",
