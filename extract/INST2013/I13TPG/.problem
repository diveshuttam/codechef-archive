Their mother got irritated and in order to quiten them thought up a game. <br />\nThey were given a string s, consisting of lowercase English letters. They play a game that is described by the following rules:</p>\n<p>The players move in turns; In one move the player can remove an arbitrary letter from string s.<br />\nIf the player before his turn can reorder the letters in string s so as to get a palindrome, this player wins. A palindrome is a string that reads the same both ways (from left to right, and vice versa). For example, string \"abba\" is a palindrome and string \"abc\" isn't.<br />\nDetermine which player will win, provided that both sides play optimally well  the one who moves first(Ram) or the one who moves second(Shyam).The brother winning will play his favourite game!</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Input:</strong><br />\nThe input contains a single line, containing string s . String s consists of lowercase English letters.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Output: </strong><br />\nIn a single line print word \"Ram\" if the first player wins (provided that both players play optimally well). Otherwise, print word \"Shyam\". Print the words without the quotes.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Sample Input 1:</strong><br />\naba</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Sample Output 1:</strong><br />\nRam</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Sample Input 2:</strong><br />\nabca</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Sample Output 2:</strong><br />\nShyam</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Constraints:</strong><br />\n1&lt;=|s|&lt;=10^6<br />\nTime Limit:1 s</p>\n<p>You will also be judged on the size of your code.</p>\n",
