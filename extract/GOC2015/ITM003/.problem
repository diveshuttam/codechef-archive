Each day he can collect only one pencil. As S can be a very large number so it could take many days to complete the task, but then he remembers that his father,chef gave him the magic that can double anything (i.e if he has 2 pencils, the magic will make them to 4 pencils). Junior_chef can use this magic any number of time on the collected pencil on a particular day and add this to the previously collected pencils. Remember that he wants exactly S pencils and he can't throw any pencil. If he gets more than S pencils then he gets 0 marks. Help him to collect exactly S pencils in minimum number of days.</p>\n<h3>Input </h3>\n<p> :\n</p><p> The first line of the input contains the number of test cases t (1&lt;=t&lt;=10^5). Then next t lines contains a single number S (0 &lt;= S &lt;= 10^9), which is number of pencils Junior_chef has to collect.</p>\n<p>Output : For each test case, output the minimum number of days taken by Junior_chef  to complete the task.<br />\n.</p>\n<h3>Sample Input</h3>\n<p>2</p>\n<p>1</p>\n<p>3</p>\n<h3>Sample Output</h3>\n<p>1</p>\n<p>2</p>\n<h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p>In the second case when s = 3, he will collect 1 stone on the first day and double it and collect the remaining one on the next day.</p>\n",
