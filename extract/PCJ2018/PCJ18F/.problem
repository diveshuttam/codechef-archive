However, Chef likes rectangles and has a favourite number $M$. \n\nHelp him find the minimum perimeter he has to fence if he wants to fence a rectangle, with slope of one of the sides as $M$, to cover all the points.\n\n###Input:\n\n- The first line contains two integers $N$ and $M$, the number of points and the Chef's favourite Number.\n- The next n lines contain two space separated integers $X$ and $Y$, the coordinates of the point.\n\n###Output:\nPrint a single decimal number, denoting the perimeter of the rectangle. Answer will considered correct if it has absolute error less than $10^{-6}$.\n\n###Constraints \n- $2 \\leq N \\leq 1000000$\n- $-1000 \\leq M \\leq 1000$\n- $-1000000 \\leq X \\leq 1000000$\n- $-1000000 \\leq Y \\leq 1000000$\n\n###Sample Input:\n        4 1\n        0 1\n        0 -1\n        1 0\n       -1 0\n\n###Sample Output:\n        5.656854249492380\n\n### Note:\n- As the input size is large, it is recommended to use Fast IO.",
