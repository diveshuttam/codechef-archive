He wants to create his own text editor. \n<br><br>\nInitially, Atoms editor contains an empty string S. He wishes his editor to perform following  type of operations:<br>\n1. Append (W) \u2013 Appends string W to the end of S.<br>\n2. Delete (k) \u2013 Deletes the last k characters from S.<br>\n3. Print (k) \u2013 Prints the kth character of S.<br>\n4. Undo() \u2013 Undo the last operation (not previously undone operation) of type 1 or 2, reverting S to the state it was in prior to that operation.<br><br>\nLet\u2019s help in creating Atoms Editor.\n<br><br><br>\n\n<b>#### Input:</b> <br><br>\nThe first line contains an integer Q denoting the number of queries or operations. <br><br>\nEach line i of Q subsequent lines ($0 \\leq i \\lt Q$) defines an operation to be performed. <br><br>\nEach operation starts with a single integer t where (t will be 1,2,3 or 4) denoting the type of operation as defined in the question above.<br><br> If the operation requires an argument, t is followed by its space-separated argument. <br>\nFor example, if t=1 and W=abcd, line will be 1 abcd.\n\n<br><br><br>\n<b>#### Constraints:</b> <br><br>\n-\t1<=Q<=10<sup>6</sup> <br>\n-\t1<=k<=|S| where |S| is the length of String S<br>\n-\tThe sum of lengths of all W in the input <= 10<sup>6</sup><br>\n-\tAll input characters are lowercase English letters.<br>\n-\tIt is guaranteed that the sequence of operations given as input is possible to perform.\n\n<br><br><br>\n\n<b>#### Output Format:</b> <br><br>\nEach operation of type 3 must print the kth character on a new line.\n\n<br><br><br>\n\n<b>#### Sample Input: </b> <br><br>\n8<br>\n1 abc<br>\n3 3<br>\n2 3<br>\n1 xy<br>\n3 2<br>\n4 <br>\n4 <br>\n3 1<br>\n\n<br><br><br>\n\n<b>#### Sample Output: </b> <br><br>\nc <br>\ny<br>\na<br>\n\n<br><br><br>\n\n<b>#### Explanation: </b> <br><br>\nInitially, S is empty. The following sequence of 8 operations are described below:\n<br><br>\n1. S= \"\".  We append abc to S , so S = abc.<br><br>\n2. Print the 3rd character on a new line. Currently, the 3rd character is c.<br><br>\n3. Delete the last 3  characters in S(abc), so now S= \"\".<br><br>\n4. Append xy to S, so S= xy.<br><br>\n5. Print the 2nd character on a new line. Currently, the 2nd character is y.<br><br>\n6. Undo the last update to S, making S empty again (i.e., S= \"\").<br><br>\n7. Undo the next to last update to S (the deletion of the last 3 characters), making S= abc.<br><br>\n8. Print the 1st character on a new line. Currently, the 1st character is a.<br><br>\n\n\n<br><br>",
