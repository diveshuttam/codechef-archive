Bio-HRQ-Comparator has three</span></p>\n    <p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n        <span>specially designed chairs each fitted with \n        brain scanning devise. Exactly three persons are to</span></p>\n    <p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n        <span>sit on the chairs and just think \n        independently and simultaneously on the best possible solution</span></p>\n    <p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n        <span>of a given problem related to an activity \n        for which HRQ is tested. The thinking process</span></p>\n    <p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n        <span>continues for a specified duration of time \n        that is dependent on the complexity of the given</span></p>\n    <p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n        <span>problem. Bio-HRQ-Comparator captures the \n        thinking process and ranks them with respect to</span></p>\n    <p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n        <span>their HRQ without any further scrutiny. \n        Through rigorous testing and analysis, ranking by Bio-</span></p>\n    <p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n        <span>HRQ-comparator has been found to be so \n        precise that no two ranked persons are identified</span></p>\n    <p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n        <span>to have different rank order or found to \n        have the same HRQ.</span></p>\n    <p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n        <span>The system has the potential to replace \n        the traditional method of selection of</span></p>\n    <p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n        <span>candidates through interview, where the \n        basic problem is to arrive at total ordering and</span></p>\n    <p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n        <span>ranking of a given set of n (assume n\u2264 20) \n        candidates with respect to their HRQ for a specific</span></p>\n    <p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n        <span>job. It is proposed to select arbitrarily \n        k sets of three candidates each and rank candidates in</span></p>\n    <p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n        <span>each set using Bio-HRQ-comparator hoping \n        that total ordering and ranking of candidates can</span></p>\n    <p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n        <span>be done successfully. However it is not \n        always possible to arrive at total ordering and ranking</span></p>\n    <p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n        <span>of all n candidates using arbitrarily \n        selected k sets of candidates.</span></p>\n    <p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n        <span>You are required to write a program that \n        either ranks all n candidates, if possible,</span></p>\n    <p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n        <span>using the k results obtained so far or \n        determines the minimum number m of additional Bio-</span></p>\n    <p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n        <span>HRQ-comparator testing required for \n        determining the total ordering and ranking of all n</span></p>\n    <p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n        <span>candidates. In case m additional testing \n        are required, the program should identify m sets of</span></p>\n    <p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n        <span>three candidates each, for additional \n        Bio-HRQ-comparator testing. Assume for simplicity that</span></p>\n    <p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n        <span>a candidate is not required to appear more \n        than twice for additional testing.</span></p>\n    <p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n        <b>\n        <span>Input</span></b></p>\n    <p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n        <span>Input may contain multiple test cases. \n        Each test case contains two lines.</span></p>\n    <p class=\"MsoNormal\">\n        <span>The 1st line gives n and a string of n \n        letters.
