    "body": "<span class=\"solution-visible-txt\">All submissions for this problem are available.</span><p>You own a large local restaurant. Because now it is very popular, you want to expand your restaurant in a neighboring country.</p>\n\n<p>The country consists N cities numbered 1 to N. There are N-1 roads connecting the cities. The country is efficiently organized, so there is exactly one path between every pairs of cities. No road will connect a city to itself.</p>\n\n<p>You want to build new restaurants in some cities. From an amateur survey, for each city i you know its profit index S<sub>i</sub>, that is the profit you will get if you build a new restaurant in city i.</p>\n\n<p>Initially, you have C chefs in city 1. You have D days to accomplish your expansion. On each day, you may perform exactly one of these options:</p>\n<p>\n<ul>\n<li>Do nothing.</li>\n<li>Transfer any number of chefs from a city to another city, provided that the two cities are connected by a road.</li>\n<li>Build a new restaurant in a city, provided that there is at least one chef in the city. After that, all chefs in the city cannot be transferred again. You can only build one restaurant per city.</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n<br />\n<p>After D days has passed, you get the profit associated with a city if the city has a restaurant. Of course, you want the maximum possible total profit. Arrange your expansion plan in order to maximize your total profit.</p>\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The first line contains three integers N, C, and D. The next line contains a sequence of N integers S<sub>i</sub>. The next N-1 lines contains two integers u<sub>i</sub> and v<sub>i</sub>, where u<sub>i</sub> and v<sub>i</sub> are the two cities connected by the i-th road.</p>\n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>In the first line, output the maximum possible total profit. The next D lines contain your expansion plan. In each of the next D lines, output exactly one of the following (quotes for clarity).</p>\n<p>\n<ul>\n<li>\"<b>nothing</b>\", if you plan to do nothing on that day.</li>\n<li>\"<b>transfer</b> a b c\", if you plan to transfer c chefs from city a to city b on that day.</li>\n<li>\"<b>build</b> a\", if you plan to build a new restaurant in city a on that day.</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n<br />\n\n<p>If there are several expansion plans that lead to the same maximum profit, you may output any.</p>\n\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<b>Input</b>\n<pre>\n4 2 5\n-10 5 2 6\n1 2\n2 3\n2 4\n</pre>\n<br />\n<b>Output</b>\n<pre>\n11\ntransfer 1 2 2\ntransfer 2 4 1\nnothing\nbuild 4\nbuild 2\n</pre>\n\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>1 &lt;= N &lt;= 30</li>\n<li>1 &lt;= C &lt;= 30</li>\n<li>1 &lt;= D &lt;= 30</li>\n<li>-1000 &lt;= S<sub>i</sub> &lt;= 1000</li>\n<li>1 &lt;= u<sub>i</sub> &lt;= N</li>\n<li>1 &lt;= v<sub>i</sub> &lt;= N</li>\n<li>u<sub>i</sub> != v<sub>i</sub></li>\n<li>There is exactly one path between every pair of cities</li>\n</ul>",
