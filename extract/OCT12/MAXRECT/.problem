    "body": "<span class=\"solution-visible-txt\">All submissions for this problem are available.</span><p>\nYou are given a matrix of the size <b>H &times; W</b> with integer elements. So it has <b>H</b> rows and <b>W</b> columns. The rows are numbered by integers in the range <b>[0, H &ndash; 1]</b> while for the columns the range <b>[0, W &ndash; 1]</b> is used. Your task is to find out a sub-rectangle of this matrix with a large sum. The sum of a sub-rectangle is the sum of all its elements. However, sub-rectangle does not need to be contiguous. More formally, you have to find out a subset of rows <b>R</b> and a subset of columns <b>C</b>. Then your sub-rectangle contains all those cells <b>(r, c)</b> where <b>r</b> is in <b>R</b> and <b>c</b> is in <b>C</b>.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThis is a challenge problem so you don't have to find out the optimal solution. You would get a partial score depending on how large the sum of your chosen rectangle is.\n</p>\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>\nThe first line of the input contains two space separated integers <b>H</b> and <b>W</b>, the height and the width of the matrix respectively. Each of the following <b>H</b> lines contains <b>W</b> space separated integers, the elements of the corresponding row of the matrix.\n</p>\n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>\nYour output should consist of 3 lines. The first line of the output should contain two space separated integers <b>R_SIZE</b> and <b>C_SIZE</b>, the sizes of your row set and the column set respectively. In the next line there should be <b>R_SIZE</b> distinct integers in the range <b>[0, H &ndash; 1]</b> in ascending order, the set of rows you have chosen. In the third line there should be <b>C_SIZE</b> distinct integers in the range <b>[0, W &ndash; 1]</b> in ascending order, the set of columns you have chosen.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n<b>Your program will get accepted if and only if all of the following conditions are satisfied:</b>\n<ol>\n<li>Both your row set and column set are non-empty, that is, <b>R_SIZE</b> &ge; <b>1</b> and <b>C_SIZE</b> &ge; <b>1</b>.</li>\n<li>The second line of your output contains <b>R_SIZE</b> distinct integers in the range <b>[0, H &ndash; 1]</b> in ascending order.</li>\n<li>The third line of your output contains <b>C_SIZE</b> distinct integers in the range <b>[0, W &ndash; 1]</b> in ascending order.</li>\n<li>The sum of your chosen sub-rectangle is positive. You are guaranteed that such a sub-rectangle always exists.</li>\n</ol>\n</p>\n\n<h3>Scoring</h3>\n<p>\nLet <b>numerator</b> = Sum of your chosen sub-rectangle<br />\nand <b>denominator</b> = Sum of all positive elements of the matrix.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThen your score for a single file is equal to <b>numerator / denominator</b>. Your total score is the average of individual scores for each file multiplied by <b>10000</b> for convenience. Your goal is to maximize your total score.\n</p>\n\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<p>\n<b>1</b> &le; <b>H</b>, <b>W</b> &le; <b>300</b><br />\nEach element of the matrix does not exceed <b>10<sup>9</sup></b> by the absolute value.\nThere exists a sub-rectangle of the given matrix which has positive sum.<br />\nIn each official test file <b>H</b>, <b>W</b> &ge; <b>200</b>.\n</p>\n\n<h3>Example</h3>\n\n<pre>\n<b>Input:</b>\n3 3\n-1 -2 4\n2 3 -1\n8 9 -1\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n1 2\n1\n1 2\n</pre>\n\n<h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p>\nIn this output the set of one row <b>R = {1}</b> and the set of two columns <b>C = {1, 2}</b> have been chosen. The chosen cells of the matrix are <b>M[1][1] = 3</b>, <b>M[1][2] = -1</b> (recall that the numeration of rows and columns is 0-based). So the sum of the chosen sub-rectangle is <b>3 + (-1) = 2 &gt; 0</b>. The sum of all positive elements of the matrix is <b>4 + 2 + 3 + 8 + 9 = 26</b>. So the score you will get for such output is <b>2 / 26 = 0.0769231</b>. Note that this is not the optimal solution for this matrix.\n</p>",
