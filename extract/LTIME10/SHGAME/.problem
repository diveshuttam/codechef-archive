Then, one cell, let's call this cell (<b>X</b>, <b>Y</b>) is marked. Then, they take the moves alternately. A move consists of making a long horizontal or vertical cut. This cut should coincide with one of the lines that divide the sheet into cells. Then, a part that doesn't contain a marked cell is thrown away and another player takes her turn. A player who is unable to make a turn because after the opponent's turn the dimensions of the sheet became equal to <b>1</b> x <b>1</b> loses. Yuuko plays first.</p>\n<p>Yuuko and Nagi have played a lot of games together so now they both know the optimal strategy and always use it. Today girls are going to play a game on a <b>N</b> x <b>M</b> cells sheet of paper, but they haven't yet decided, what is the cell (<b>X</b>, <b>Y</b>) to be marked. Yuuko is interested, in how many ways it's possible to choose this cell so the she can become a winner, regardless of Nagi's moves.</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The first line of input consists of an integer <b>T</b> - the number of test cases. Then, <b>T</b> lines describing the test cases follow. The <b>i</b>-th such line contains two integers <b>N</b> and <b>M</b>, separated by a single space.</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>\nFor each test case, output a single line containing the number of ways to choose the marked cell in order to ensure Yuuko's win.</p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n2\n5 8\n6 7\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n40\n42\n</pre><h3>Scoring</h3>\n<p><b>T</b> = 100, 1 &lt;= <b>N</b>, <b>M</b> &lt;= 10 : 25 points.<br /><br />\n<b>T</b> = 100, 1 &lt;= <b>N</b>, <b>M</b> &lt;= 1000 : 36 points.<br /><br />\n<b>T</b> = 100, 1 &lt;= <b>N</b>, <b>M</b> &lt;= 10<sup>6</sup> : 39 points.</p>\n",
