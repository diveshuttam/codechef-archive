After playing one game for a long time, they decided to invent another game!\n\nIn this game, they have a sequence $A_1, A_2, \\dots, A_N$ and two numbers $Z_1$ and $Z_2$. The rules of the game are as follows:\n- The players take turns alternately, starting with Vanja.\n- There is an integer $S$; at the beginning, $S = 0$.\n- In each turn, the current player must choose an arbitrary element of $A$ and either add that number to $S$ or subtract it from $S$. Each element can be selected multiple times.\n- Afterwards, if $S = Z_1$ or $S = Z_2$, the current player (the player who made $S$ equal to $Z_1$ or $Z_2$) is the winner of the game.\n- If the game lasts for $10^{10}$ turns, Vanja and Miksi decide to declare it a tie.\n\nCan you help the boys determine the winner of the game? Please note that the game can end in a tie (if nobody can make $S = Z_1$ or $S = Z_2$ in the first $10^{10}$ moves).\n\nBoth players play optimally, i.e. if there is a move which guarantees the current player's victory regardless of the other player's moves, the current player will make such a move. If the current player cannot win and there is a move which guarantees that the game will end in a tie, the current player will make such a move.\n\n### Input\n- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.\n- The first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers $N$, $Z_1$ and $Z_2$.\n- The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers $A_1, A_2, \\dots, A_N$.\n\n### Output\n- For each test case, print a single line containing one integer \u2014 the final result of the game:\n    - $1$ if Vanja (the first player) has a winning strategy\n    - $2$ if Miksi (the second player) has a winning strategy\n    - $0$ if the game ends in a tie\n \n### Constraints\n- $1 \\le T \\le 50$\n- $1 \\le N \\le 50$\n- $|Z_1|, |Z_2| \\le 10^9$\n- $|A_i| \\le 10^9$ for each valid $i$\n\n### Subtasks\n**Subtask #1 (25 points):** $N = 2$\n\n**Subtask #2 (75 points):** original constraints\n\n### Example Input\n```\n3\n2 6 4\n-4 10\n1 1 -1\n2\n2 0 7\n3 4\n```\n\n### Example Output\n```\n1\n0\n2\n```\n\n### Explanation\n**Example case 1:** The first player can choose the value $A_1 = -4$, subtract it from $S = 0$ and obtain $S = - (-4) = 4 = Z_2$. The winner is the first player.  \n\n**Example case 2:** It can be proven that neither player is able to reach $S = Z_1$ or $S = Z_2$. The result is a tie.\n",
