He always wants to reach the lecture hall well before the scheduled class timings. As the distance between the hostel and lecture hall is too long , he travels using a bicycle. He likes to ride straight and doesn\u2019t like to turn the bicycle as it reduces his speed, so he always chooses  a path which has the least number of turns from hostel to lecture hall. The college is a modeled as  <b> R X C </b> grid of points<b> (1&lt;=R,C&lt;=100).</b> It consists of roads which are depicted by  <b> \u201c.\u201d</b> and  bushes  are depicted by <b> \u201c *\u201d</b>. Obviously Ajinkya  can\u2019t ride through the bushes and only has to take the roads. The hostel is denoted by <b>\u201cH\u201d</b> and lecture hall is denoted by <b>\u201cL\u201d</b>.  Help  Ajinkya  to choose a path to minimize the number of turns.  \u00a0</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>Input description.<br />\nThe first line contains two spaced integers \u2018R\u2019 and \u2018C\u2019 which are the no of rows and columns in college map.
