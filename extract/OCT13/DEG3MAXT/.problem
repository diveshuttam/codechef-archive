Each road connects two different cities <b>i</b> and <b>j</b> and has a cost <b>C(i,j)</b> - this is the cost paid by the drivers which use this road (and, thus, it is Chef's profit). The road network has the following properties:\n<ul>\n<li>it is possible to reach any city from any other city using the existing roads</li>\n<li>any subset <b>S</b> of <b>10</b> or more cities contains at least two different cities <b>A</b> and <b>B</b> such that all the paths between <b>A</b> and <b>B</b> have at least one city <b>X</b> (<b>X\u2260A</b> and <b>X\u2260B</b>) in common (note that <b>X</b> does not necessarily belong to <b>S</b>) - note that this implies that if the city <b>X</b> were to be removed from the network, then no path would exist anymore between the cities <b>A</b> and <b>B</b></li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n<p>However, the anti-monopoly committee decided that Chef is making too much money and that some restrictions should be imposed. Chef will be allowed to keep a part <b>P</b> of the road network that he chooses, provided that:\n<ul>\n<li>there exists exactly one path from any city in <b>P</b> to any other city in <b>P</b> using only the roads from <b>P</b> (this means that the sets of cities and roads from <b>P</b> form a tree)</li>\n<li>every city from <b>P</b> has <b>at most 3</b> roads from <b>P</b> adjacent to it\n</li></ul>\n</p>\n<p>Note that <b>P</b> may consist of any subset of the <b>N</b> cities and any subset of roads connecting these cities, as long as the two restrictions are satisfied. However, Chef doesn't want to simply pick any part <b>P</b> of the road network which satisfies the restrictions. He would like to choose a part <b>P</b> for which the total cost of the roads which belong to <b>P</b> is <b>maximum</b>. Moreover, he would also like to know how many such parts <b>P</b> of maximum total cost exist. Two parts <b>P1</b> and <b>P2</b> are considered different if their subsets of cities are different or if their subsets of roads are different.</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The first line contains the integer number <b>T</b> denoting the number of test cases. The description of the <b>T</b> test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains the integer numbers <b>N</b> and <b>M</b>. Each of the next <b>M</b> lines contains three space-separated integers: <b>i, j</b> and <b>C(i,j)</b>, meaning that there is a road between the cities <b>i</b> and <b>j</b> having cost <b>C(i,j)</b>.</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>For each test case print a line containing two numbers: <b>CMAX</b> and <b>CNT32</b>. <b>CMAX</b> is the maximum cost of any part <b>P</b> which satisfies the restrictions imposed by the anti-monopoly committee. Let <b>CNT</b> be the total number of different parts <b>P</b> which have maximum cost and satisfy the restrictions. <b>CNT32</b> is equal to <b>CNT modulo 2<sup>32</sup></b> (i.e. we are only interested in the remainder of <b>CNT</b> when divided by <b>2<sup>32</sup></b>).</p>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>T</b> \u2264 <b>6</b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>N</b> \u2264 <b>100</b></li>\n<li><b>N-1</b> \u2264 <b>M</b> \u2264 <b>min(N\u00d7(N-1)/2, 450)</b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>i, j</b> \u2264 <b>N</b> (<b>i\u2260j</b>)</li>\n<li><b>-10000</b> \u2264 <b>C(i,j)</b> \u2264 <b>10000</b></li>\n<li>There exists at most one road connecting each pair of different cities.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n6\n6 7\n1 3 1\n3 5 2\n5 1 3\n5 2 1\n2 4 2\n4 6 3\n6 5 1\n4 4\n1 2 0\n2 3 0\n3 4 0\n2 4 0\n4 4\n1 2 -1\n2 3 -2\n3 4 -3\n2 4 -4\n8 7\n1 2 1\n2 3 1\n3 4 1\n4 5 -2\n5 6 1\n6 7 1\n7 8 1\n8 7\n1 2 1\n2 3 1\n3 4 1\n4 5 -3\n5 6 1\n6 7 1\n7 8 1\n8 7\n1 2 1\n1 3 2\n1 4 3\n1 5 4\n1 6 5\n1 7 6\n1 8 7\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n11 2\n0 17\n0 5\n4 1\n3 3\n18 1\n</pre><p/>\n<h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p><b>Example case 1.</b> The maximum cost of a part P which satisfies the restrictions is 11. There are two such maximum cost parts, both of them containing all the cities and the following roads:\n<ul>\n<li><b>(1,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,5), (4,6)</b></li>\n<li><b>(1,5), (2,4), (3,5), (4,6), (5,6)</b></li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n<p><b>Example case 2.</b> All the roads have cost 0, thus the maximum cost of any part P satisfying the restrictions is 0. The 17 different parts are as follows:\n<ul>\n<li>1 part containing 0 cities</li>\n<li>4 parts containing 1 city (1 part for each of the 4 cities)</li>\n<li>4 parts containing 2 cities and the road between them: {1,2}, {2, 3}, {2,4} and {3,4}</li>\n<li>5 parts containing 3 cities:\n<ul>\n<li>cities 1, 2, 3 and the roads (1,2) and (2,3)</li>\n<li>cities 1, 2, 4 and the roads (1,2) and (2,4)</li>\n<li>cities 2, 3, 4 and the roads (2,3) and (3,4)</li>\n<li>cities 2, 3, 4 and the roads (2,3) and (2,4)</li>\n<li>cities 2, 3, 4 and the roads (2,4) and (3,4)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>3 parts containing all the 4 cities and the following roads:\n<ul>\n<li>(1,2), (2,3), (3,4)</li>\n<li>(1,2), (2,3), (2,4)</li>\n<li>(1,2), (2,4), (3,4)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n<p><b>Example case 3.</b> The maximum cost part P which satisfies the restrictions does not contain any of the roads. Thus, there are 5 possible ways of choosing P, consisting of the following sets of cities: <b>{1}, {2}, {3}, {4}, {}</b>.\n</p>\n<p><b>Example case 4.</b> Chef decides to keep the entire road network, because it satisfies the restrictions and has the maximum total cost among all of its parts.\n</p>\n<p><b>Example case 5.</b> Chef has 3 choices for the maximum cost part (whose cost is 3):\n<ul>\n<li>it can choose the entire road network</li>\n<li>it can choose the cities 1, 2, 3, 4 and the roads (1,2), (2,3), (3,4)</li>\n<li>it can choose the cities 5, 6, 7, 8 and the roads (5,6), (6,7), (7,8)</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n<p><b>Example case 6.</b> Chef chooses the cities 1, 6, 7, 8 and the roads (1,6), (1,7), (1,8).\n</p>\n</p/>",
