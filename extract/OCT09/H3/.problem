He has even invented an interesting counting problem involving congruent triangles!\n</p>\n<p>Recall that two triangles are congruent if their corresponding sides are equal in length and their corresponding angles are equal in size. A lattice triangle is a triangle such that the coordinates of all its vertices are integers. Johnny's problem can now be described as follows:</p>\n<p>\nYou are given an integer M and a lattice triangle ABC all of whose vertices (A, B, and C) are inside rectangle R<sub>M</sub>. R<sub>M</sub> is the rectangle having (0,0) as its bottom-left corner and (M,M) as its top-right corner. In other words, 0 \u2264 x<sub>A</sub>, y<sub>A</sub>, x<sub>B</sub>, y<sub>B</sub>, x<sub>C</sub>, y<sub>C</sub> \u2264 M. The problem is to count the number of lattice triangles congruent to ABC also having all their vertices inside the rectangle R<sub>M</sub>.</p>\n<p>Could you help Johnny write a program to solve this problem?</p>\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The first line contains t, the number of test cases (about 10). Then t test cases follow. Each test case has the following form:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The first line contains two numbers M and K (1 \u2264 M \u2264 1000, 1 \u2264 K \u2264 1000). K is the number of given triangles.</li>\n<li>Each line in the next K lines contains 6 integers x<sub>A</sub>, y<sub>A</sub>, x<sub>B</sub>, y<sub>B</sub>, x<sub>C</sub>, y<sub>C</sub> (0 \u2264 x<sub>A</sub>, y<sub>A</sub>, x<sub>B</sub>, y<sub>B</sub>, x<sub>C</sub>, y<sub>C</sub> \u2264 M) describing a triangle ABC. It is guaranteed that ABC is always a triangle (i.e., non-degenerate).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The input for successive test cases is separated by a blank line.</p>\n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>For each test case, output a line containing the string \"Case #T:\" where T should be replaced by the corresponding test case number.</p>\n<p>Then, K lines should follow, each line containing the number of triangles having vertices inside the rectangle R<sub>M</sub>, congruent to the corresponding triangle given in the input.</p>\n<p>Print a blank line after each test case.</p>\n\n<h3>Example</h3>\n\n<pre>\n<b>Input:</b>\n2\n\n2 2\n0 0 0 2 2 0\n0 0 1 1 2 0\n\n3 2\n0 0 0 2 2 0\n0 0 1 1 2 0\n\n<b>Output:</b>\nCase #1:\n4\n8\n\nCase #2:\n16\n24\n</pre>\n<h3>Output details</h3>\n<p>The 8 triangles congruent to the second triangle (in the first test case) are presented in the following figure:</p>\n<img src='http://www.codechef.com/download/h3.png'/>\n",
