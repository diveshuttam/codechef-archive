So, his computer science teacher has asked him to play with the following puzzle game frequently.</p>\n<p>The puzzle is a 3x3 board consisting of numbers from 1 to 9. The objective of the puzzle is to swap the tiles until the following final state is reached:</p>\n<pre>\n1 2 3\n4 5 6\n7 8 9\n</pre>\n<p>At each step, Johnny may swap two adjacent tiles <b>if their sum is a prime number.</b> Two tiles are considered adjacent if they have a common edge.</p>\n<p>Help Johnny to find the shortest number of steps needed to reach the goal state.</p>\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The first line contains t, the number of test cases (about 50). Then t test cases follow. Each test case consists of a 3x3 table describing a puzzle which Johnny would like to solve.</p>\n<p>The input data for successive test cases is separated by a blank line.</p>\n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>For each test case print a single line containing the shortest number of steps needed to solve the corresponding puzzle. If there is no way to reach the final state, print the number -1.</p>\n\n<h3>Example</h3>\n\n<pre>\n<b>Input:</b>\n2\n\n7 3 2 \n4 1 5 \n6 8 9 \n\n9 8 5 \n2 4 1 \n3 7 6  \n\n<b>Output:</b>\n6\n-1\n</pre>\n<h3>Output details</h3>\n<p>The possible 6 steps in the first test case are described in the following figure:</p>\n<img src='https://campus.codechef.com/images/problems/h1.png' />\n",
