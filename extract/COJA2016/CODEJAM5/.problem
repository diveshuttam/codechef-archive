The following theorem needed a proof or a counterexample: Suppose we are given a set of words of equal length; each word consisting of 0's, 1's and/or *'s. Also suppose that the pattern of *'s is different for all words in the set.<br /><br />\nThe claim is: if you the *'s are replaced by 0's and 1's in all possible ways, then you obtain a set that is at least as big as the set you started with initially.<br /><br /><br />\nExample:<br /><br />\n{ 10*, *0*, *00 } produces { 100, 101, 000, 001 }<br /><br />\n{ 100, 101, 10* } produces { 100, 101 }<br /><br /><br />\nNotice that the set in the latter example does not satisfy the condidtion mentioned above, so it does<br />\nnot provide a counterexample.<br /><br /><br />\nWrite a program which has to check for a number of cases:<br /><br />\n1. Whether the pattern of *'s is different for all words in the set and:<br /><br />\n2. Compute the number of words obtained by replacing the *'s by 0's and 1's.<br /><br /><br />\nThe words will not be longer than 15 symbols(containing 0's,1's and *'s).<br />\n</p>\n<p><br /><br />\n<h3>\nInput</h3>\n</p><p>\nThe input is of the format of a text-file that represents a sequence of sets. Each set is described as follows. The first line<br />\ngives only two non negative integers: the length of the words and the number of the words. Then follow the words, one word<br />\non a separate line. The end of the sequence of sets is indicated by a set with wordlength 0 and number of words equal to 0. </p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>\nThe output is a textfile that has one line for each set. if the pattern of *'s is different for all the<br />\nwords in this set this line should contain YES (in uppercase), followed by a space and the number of<br />\nobtained words, otherwise it should contain NO (uppercase) only.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Sample Input</b><br />\n3 3<br />\n10*<br />\n*0*<br />\n*00<br /></p>\n<p>\n<b>Sample Output</b><br />\nYES 4</p>\n",
