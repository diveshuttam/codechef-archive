The<br />\nlast digit becomes first and vice versa. For instance, if the number is  4628<br />\nthe number becomes 8264 of now. Note that all the leading zeros are omitted. That means if the<br />\nnumber ends with a zero, the zero is lost by mirroring (e.g. 1400 gives 41). Another point to note is that there will be no trailing zeroes in the mirrored numbers.<br />\nQUARK managers need to calculate with mirrored numbers. Your task is to add two mirrored numbers and<br />\noutput their mirrored sum. Of course, the result is not unique because any particular number is a<br />\nmirrored form of several numbers (e.g. 41 could be 14, 140 or 1400 before mirroring). Thus we must<br />\nassume that no zeros were lost by mirroring (e.g. assume that the original number was 14).\n</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>\nThe input has N cases. The first line of the input consists of only one positive integer N. After which follow<br />\nthe N cases. Each case consists of exactly one line which has two positive integers separated by a space. These<br />\nare the mirrored numbers which you are required to add. Numbers will be at most 250 digits long.<br />\n<h3>Output</h3>\n</p><p>For each case, print exactly one line containing only one integer \u2014 the mirrored sum of two mirrored<br />\nnumbers. Omit any leading zeros in the output.</p>\n<p>\n<br /><br />\n<b><br />\nSample Input</b>\n</p><p>\n2<br />\n24 1<br />\n4358 754</p>\n\n<p><b><br />\nSample Output</b></p>\n<p>34<br />\n1998</p>\n",
