The game is extremely simple, yet quite additive. Here's the rule:\n<p>Given a MxN rectangular grid in which each cell contains a unique number from 1 to MxN. In each step, the player can pick any 2x2 subgrid and perform a rotation (whether clockwise or counterclockwise).\n<p>The task is to transform from the initial grid to the final configuration, using as few steps as possible.\n<p>The final configuration is the configuration</p>\n<table>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>...</td>\n<td>n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>n+1</td>\n<td>n+2</td>\n<td>...</td>\n<td>2n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>...</td>\n<td>...</td>\n<td>...</td>\n<td>...</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>(m-1)n+1</td>\n<td>(m-1)n+2</td>\n<td>...</td>\n<td>mn</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<p>You may have guessed why this game is addictive: it requires a tremendous visualization skill!\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The first line contains a number T (about 5000), which is the number of test cases. Each test case has the following form.\n<p>The first line contains two numbers M and N (2 <= M, N <= 33).\n<p>The next M lines contains the description of the grid.\n<p>Each test case's input is separated by a blank line.\n<p>It is guaranteed that each input data has a solution.\n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>For each test case, output the result in the following format.\n<p>The first line contains a number K, the number of steps you need to solve the puzzle. K must not exceed 10000.\n<p>Each line of the next K lines contain three numbers c, i, j (c=0 or c=1, 1<=I < M, 1 <= J < N). (i,j) is the top-left coordinate of the 2x2 square that is need to be rotated. c=1 if the rotation if clockwise and c=0 if the rotation is counter-clockwise.\n<p>Prints a blank link after each test case's output.\n\n<h3>Scoring</h3>\nGiven m and n, we pick a random positive integer K* and starting from the final configuration, we perform a random operation K* times to generate the test case. \nFor each test case, your score is K*/K. \nHigher score is\nbetter.\n<h3>Example</h3>\n\n<pre>\n<b>Input:</b>\n2\n\n2 3\n1 5 2\n4 6 3\n\n2 3\n5 6 2\n1 4 3\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n1\n0 1 2\n\n2\n1 1 1\n0 1 2\n</pre>\n",
