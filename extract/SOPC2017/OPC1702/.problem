Knowing it\u2019s impossible to defeat superman by himself, he makes lot of kryptonite bullets which would make superman weak. Each time batman shoots a kryptonite bullet at him, superman\u2019s strength  becomes half as that of batman. Because of his healing factor superman regains <b>p*(S-X)</b> units of his strength back every second. Here <b>p</b> is a parameter between 0 and 1, <b>S</b> is superman\u2019s actual strength and <b>X</b> is his current strength. Batman needs to shoot the next bullet before superman\u2019s strength becomes strictly above his. Tell me \u2026 can you find the maximum complete seconds batman can fight before he should shoot the next bullet ?</p>\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The first line of the input contains an integer <b>T</b> denoting the number of test cases. The description of <b>T</b> test cases follows.</li>\n<li>The first line of each test case contains a two space separated integers <b>S</b> and <b>B</b> denoting the strength of superman and batman respectively.</li>\n<li>The second line of each test case contains a floating point number <b>p</b>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>For each test case output a single integer in a seperate line with the maximum complete seconds batman can fight before he should shoot the next bullet.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>T</b> \u2264 <b>100000</b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>B</b> < <b>S</b> \u2264 <b>10<sup>8</sup></b></li>\n<li><b>10<sup>-8</sup></b> \u2264 <b>p</b> < <b>1</b></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n3\n16 8\n0.5\n9 6\n0.5\n16 6\n0.1\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n0\n1\n2\n</pre>\n<h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p>In the first test case superman\u2019s strength drops to 4 units as soon as batman shoots the kryptonite bullet and his strength would increase by 6 units at the end of the first second exceeding batman\u2019s strength. Thus batman can fight only for 0 complete seconds before superman\u2019s strength exceeds his.\n</p>\n<p>In the second test case superman\u2019s strength drops to 3 units as soon as batman shoots the kryptonite bullet and his strength would increase by 6 units at the end of the 2nd second strictly exceeding batman\u2019s strength. Thus batman can fight only for 1 complete second before superman\u2019s strength exceeds his. Note at the end of the first second superman's strength doesn't exceed that of batman making batman capable of fighting for 1 complete second.</p>\n",
