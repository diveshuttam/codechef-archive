    "body": "<span class=\"solution-visible-txt\">All submissions for this problem are available.</span><p>Ram brought home <b>N</b> identical crackers, and arranged them in a row. He then numbered all the crackers with positive integer numbers such that product of any two numbers is less than or equal to <b>K</b>. He also ensured that the numbers read from left most cracker to right most cracker are in non-decreasing order.</p>\n<p>Ravana took away all the crackers when Ram was not at home. To keep things simple, Cool dude Laxman brought <b>N</b> new identical crackers. Now he want to number them following the conditions Ram followed, but he realized that there are multiple ways to do it.</p>\n<p>Given <b>N</b> and <b>K</b>, write a program to output the number of ways to number the crackers. If there are infinite ways to do it, output \"<b>-1</b>\" instead.</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The first line of the input contains an integer <b>T</b> denoting the number of test cases.<br />\nOnly line of each testcase contains two integer numbers <b>N</b> and <b>K</b>.</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>For each test case output one line. If the number of ways is infinite print \"<b>-1</b>\". If the number of ways is finite, print the required answer modulo <b>1000000007</b>.</p>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>T, N, K</b> \u2264 <b>100000</b></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n2\n2 1\n2 2\n<b>Output:</b>\n1\n2\n</pre><h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p><b>Test case #1:</b><br />\nWe need to number 2 crackers. And the product of any two numbers should not exceed 1. The only possible numbering is \"1 1\"\n</p>\n<p><b>Test case #2:</b><br />\nIn this case the product of any two numbers should not exceed 2. Two possible ways are \"1 1\" and \"1 2\".<br />\nNote that \"2 1\" is invalid because Ram ensured that the numbering from left to right is non-decreasing.\n</p>\n",
