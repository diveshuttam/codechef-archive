Johnny has formed teams to go to the houses and each team has a specific success rate.Johnny does not know which team goes where and the success rate is the maxmium % of amount the team can loot.<br />\nJohnny did some research and found the net value of each house. Help Johnny analyse all his options and calculate all possible options to get the average maximum amount of money.<br />\nFor example, if there are 6 houses on the street, and any 3 are empty with the probability 1/20. Then he will calculate the average of the  maximum possible loot in each case.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Input </h3>\n<p>the first  line consists the number t indicating the number of test cases.<br />\nIn the following t cases consists of 3 lines each where <br /><br />\nthe first line contains N houses and the K empty houses seperated by a line  <br /><br />\nthe second line contains N integers which the net estimated value of each Each house<br /><br />\nthe thrid line contains K lines consist of  suucess rate of each team</p>\n<h3>Output </h3>\n<p>For each test case, print the expected amount of money johnny would expect rounded off to 3 digits</p>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<p>1 &lt;= t &lt;= 100,<br />\n1 &lt;= n &lt;= 1000,<br />\n1&lt;= k &lt;=  n</p>\n<p>For each test case, print the expected amount of money johnny would expect rounded off to 3 digits</p>\n<h3>Sample Input</h3>\n<p>2</p>\n<p>4 2</p>\n<p>100 200 300 400</p>\n<p>20 40</p>\n<p>3 1</p>\n<p>70 80 90</p>\n<p>10</p>\n\n<h3>Sample Output</h3>\n<p>166.667</p>\n<p>8.000</p>\n\n",
