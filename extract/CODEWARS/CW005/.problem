In the game, there are 100 gobstones arranged in a row for each of them, such that the Mth gobstone is always M paces from the beginning. Both Ron and Harry have to start from the 1st gobstone. In one step they can either walk in either direction or transform a gobstone into a toad.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tTo beat Malfoy and win the game, both Harry and Ron have to transform the gobstones in a certain sequence. Both of them know the sequence in advance. What is the least number of steps in which they can complete it?\n</p>\n<p></p><p>\n\tConsider the following example:<br/><br />\n\tH 3, R 1, R 2, H 4 <br/><br />\n\tHere, H 2 means gobstone 2 in Harry\u2019s row, R 1 means gobstone 1 in Ron\u2019s row, and so on. Harry/Ron can win the game in 7 steps using the strategy shown below:\n</br/></br/></p>\n<p>\n\tStep| Harry | Ron <br /><br />\n\t-----+------------------+----------------- <br/><br />\n\t1   | Move to gobstone 2 \t| Stay at gobstone 1 <br/><br />\n\t2   | Move to gobstone 3    | Stay at gobstone 1 <br/><br />\n\t3   | Transform gobstone 3  | Stay at gobstone 1 <br/><br />\n\t4   | Move to gobstone 4    | Transform gobstone 1 <br/><br />\n\t5   | Stay at gobstone 4    | Move to gobstone 2 <br/><br />\n\t6   | Stay at gobstone 4    | Transform gobstone 2 <br/><br />\n\t7   | Transform gobstone 4  | Stay at gobstone 2 <br/></br/></br/></br/></br/></br/></br/></br/></br/></p>\n<p><b>Input</b></p>\n<p>\n\tInput format is as follows:<br/><br />\n\tT where T represents number of test cases.\n</br/></p>\n<p>\n\tFor each test case, on a new line each time, write a positive integer N which is the number of gobstones that need to be transformed.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tAfter this, write out the sequence that Harry and Ron should follow, in the form '[Initial letter of player] [Gobstone position]'. For example, H 1, R 2 and so on.\n</p>\n<p><b>OUTPUT</b></p>\n<p>\n\tFor each test case, output the number of steps required on a new line.\n</p>\n<p><b>CONSTRAINTS</b></p>\n<p>\n\t1\u2264 T \u2264100<br /><br />\n\t1\u2264 No. of Gobstones \u2264 100\n</p>\n",
