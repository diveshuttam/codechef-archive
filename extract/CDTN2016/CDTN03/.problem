He is the only hope to save the country from enemies as they have a new biological weapon which is so deadly that when it hits a particular area, it also wipes out the areas adjacent to it.Although if the weapon hits the water bodies, then it wont have any effect.<br><br>\n\nGiven an <strong>NxM </strong>map which has NxM cells. Each cell may represent an area or a water body.<br>\nThe weapon cannot penetrate a water body or the edges of the map.\n<br><br>\nYou will be given a initial state of the country represented by an <strong>N x M </strong>grid consists of 0 or 1 representing water body and area respectively. Also there will be <strong>Q</strong> attacks of the biological weapon. After each query, you are to tell the number of areas still intact.<strong>Once an area is hit, the effect is directed to all the areas until it is stopped by a water body</strong><br><br>\n<strong>Input:</strong>\n<br><br>\nFirst line of input contains 3 space separated integers <strong>N,M,Q </strong>where<strong> N x M </strong>is the size of the country.<strong> Q</strong> is the number of attacks.<br><br>\n<strong>N</strong> lines follow each with <strong>M </strong>values of either 0 or 1, denoting whether that particular coordinate is a <strong>area(1)</strong> or <strong>water body(0)</strong>. <br><br>\n<strong>Q</strong> lines follow. Each line has a coordinate X,Y where the next attack takes place.<br><br>\n\n<strong>Output:</strong><br><br>\n\nFor each <strong>Q</strong>, output the number of areas still existing on a single line.<br><br>\n\n<strong>Note</strong>:<br>\n\nTwo areas are said to be adjacent if they share an edge.\nEnemy can shoot the weapon at any place on the country within its domain any number of times.<br><br>\nOnce an area is destroyed, it will continue to remain destroyed over all the forthcoming queries.<br><br>\nLarge IO. Prefer scanf/printf(in C/C++).\n<br><br>\n<strong>Constraints:</strong>\n<br><br>\n1 \u2264 N,M \u2264 103<br>\n1 \u2264 X \u2264 N<br>\n1 \u2264 Y \u2264 M<br>\n1 \u2264 Q \u2264 106<br>\n\n<strong>Sample Input:</strong> <br><br>\n3 3 3<br>\n0 0 0<br>\n1 0 1<br>\n0 1 1<br>\n1 2<br>\n2 2<br>\n3 3<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Sample Output:</strong> <br><br>\n4<br>\n4<br>\n1<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Explanation</strong><br><br>\nQuery 1: (1,2) No area is hit. Intact areas=4 (initial)<br>\nQuery 2: (2,2) No area is hit. Still intact=4<br>\nQuery 3: (3,3) is hit and it also spreads to (2,3) and (3,2) also. Thus only 1 area is left (1,2).<br><br>\n\n\n",
