    "body": "<span class=\"solution-visible-txt\">All submissions for this problem are available.</span><p>\nAmortized analysis deals with analyzing the average amount of work done per operation over a series of operations. In some cases, the average amount of work done per operation is dramatically less than the worst case analysis indicates.\n\n</p><p>\nA typical example is counting the number of times a bit is flipped in a ripple-carry counter. A ripple-carry counter is an implementation of a binary counter where incrementing from B to B+1 is done in the following manner. Say the binary number is represented as B = b<sub>n-1</sub>b_<sub>n-2</sub>...b_<sub>1</sub>b<sub>0</sub> where b<sub>i</sub> is the bit corresponding to 2<sup>i</sup>. B is increased to B+1 in the following manner:\n\n</p><p>\n<code>\ni := 0<br />\nwhile b<sub>i</sub> == 1<br />\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0b<sub>i</sub> := 0<br />\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0i := i+1<br />\nb<sub>i</sub> := 1\n</code>\n\n</p><p>\nThis doesn't account for overflow when increasing from 2<sup>n</sup>-1 to 2<sup>n</sup>, but we'll ignore that error for this problem.\n\n</p><p>\nEach time a bit is changed from 0 to 1 or from 1 to 0 we say the bit is \"flipped\". In the worst case, we may have to flip every bit. However, a standard result says the average number of bits flipped per increment when counting from 0 to 2<sup>n</sup>-1 is less than 2.\n\n</p><p>\nBeing the curious sort, you decide to explore this result in a slightly more general setting. That is, you want to know how many bits are flipped when the counter is incremented from a number a to b where a &lt; b. \n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n</p><p>\nThe first line denotes the number of test cases (about 20).\n\n</p><p>\nEach test case consists of three lines. The first contains a single integer n between 1 and 100,000 denoting the number of bits in the counter. The second line contains the number a written in binary and the third line contains the number b written in binary. Both a and b are described using exactly n bits.\n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n</p><p>\nThe output for each test case consists of a single line that describes the total number of bits flipped when the counter is increased from a to b. This number should be expressed in binary with the most significant bit being 1 (i.e. no leading zeros should pad the output).\n\n<h3>Example</h3>\n\n<pre>\n<b>Input:</b>\n3\n1\n0\n1\n2\n00\n11\n3\n011\n100\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n1\n100\n11\n\n</pre></p>",
