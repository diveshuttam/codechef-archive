    "body": "<p>You have been given a 4x4 board which consists of integers from 1 to 50. A two player game is played on this board with the following rules :\n\n<ol>\n<li>The first player can pick any number from the board, this is added to his personal total.</li>\n\n<li>Now the next person can only pick a number that was adjacent to the number picked by the earlier player. (Two cells are adjacent if they share a side). If all the adjacent cells are empty, the player can pick a number from any cell.</li>\n\n<li>The game ends when all the numbers have been picked from the board, i.e. in exactly 16 moves.\n</li>\n</ol>\n\n</p>\n<p>\nYou task in this problem is given a board configuration, return the maximal difference in the personal totals of player 1 and player 2 , assuming they play optimally.\n</p>\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The first line of input would consist of a single integer 'T' denoting the number of test cases, T < 1000. This is followed by 4T lines , where each set of 4 lines describe the board configuration with space separated integers. Each test case would be separated by a new line.</p>\n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>You have to output a single integer denoting the maximal difference in the personal totals of player 1 and player 2 that is possible.\n</p>\n\n<h3>Example</h3>\n\n<pre>\n<b>Input:</b>\n2\n1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1\n\n1 1 1 1\n1 1 5 1\n1 1 2 1\n1 1 1 1\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n0\n3\n</pre>\n",
