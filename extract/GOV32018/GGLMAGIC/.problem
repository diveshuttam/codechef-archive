    "body": "<span class=\"solution-visible-txt\">All submissions for this problem are available.</span>A famous traveling magician has come to your city to showcase his grand magic tricks, but he isn't able to fool you! You quickly realize that most of his tricks aren't really magic at all - they just appear to be so at first sight. For his final trick, he has claimed to be able to solve the following problem -\n\nGiven an array $A$, a _magical subarray_ is defined as a selection of at most $k$ contiguous elements from the array. Find a _magical subarray_ for which the [GCD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor) of all its elements is maximal. In other words, if $G$ is the largest integer that divides all the elements of a _magical subarray_, find a _magical subarray_ having maximum value of $G$. For a single integer $x$, $GCD(x)$ is defined as $|x|$. If there are multiple candidate answers, print any candidate _magical subarray_ having minimum number of elements.\n\nYou see right through the magician's \"magic\" trick, right? Solve the above problem before he does and unravel his tricks.\n\n###Input:\n- The first line contains $T$, denoting the number of test cases that follow\n- The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $k$, denoting the size of the array and the maximum allowed size of a _magical subarray_.\n- The second line of each test case contains $N$ space-separated integers, the array $A$\n\n###Output:\n- For each test case, output an integer $X$ in the first line, the size of the _magical subarray_ that is the answer (Remember, if there are multiple possible answers, choose any one with least number of elements).\n- In the next line, print $X$ contiguous elements from the array\n\n###Constraints\n- $1 \\leq T \\leq 10$\n- $1 \\leq |A_i| \\leq 10^{18}$\n- $1 \\leq k \\leq N$\n\n###Subtasks\n- 40 points: $1 \\leq $N$ \\leq 1000$\n- 60 points: $1 \\leq $N$ \\leq 10^5$\n\n###Sample Input\n1\n\n1 1\n\n5\n\n###Sample Output\n1\n\n5",
