For the working and smooth functioning of this world, the Legendary Eagle Master XAstralis connected these planets with Nova Bridges of different lengths. XAstralis being busy playing CsGo connected these planets minimally. He made sure that all the planets in the CSGo-World are connected. Also, a player crossing a Nova Bridge of length $L$ needs to pay $L$ coins. \n\nXPannu The Global Elite of this world lives on planet $X$. XScope landed on planet $Y$ needs to visit XPannu for spray control training. XPannu said he will pay the cost of all even length bridges if the total length traveled by XScope is even or he will pay the cost of all odd length bridges if the total length traveled by XScope is odd.\n\nXScope needs to buy coins from XShadow for his travel. He being a pro gamer of Earth found the minimum number of coins he needed to pay. Can you find the same?\n\n###Input:\n\nThe first line of input contains three positive integers $N$ $M$ $Q$ where $N$ is the total number of planets in CsGo-World, $M$ is the total number of Nova Bridges and $Q$ is the number of queries you need to perform.\n\nEach of the following $M$ lines contain three integers $U$ $V$ $L$ describing a Nova Bridge of length $L$ between planets $U$ and $V$.\n\nEach of next $Q$ lines contain two integers $X$ $Y$ describing the position of XPannu and XScope. For each query $X$ $Y$ output the minimum number of coins XScope needs to buy from XShadow to travel from planet $Y$ to planet $X$.\n\n###Output:\nFor each query output the minimum number of coins XScope needs to buy from XShadow in a new line.\n\n###Constraints \n\n$1\\leq U, V, X, Y \\leq N$\n\n$1\\leq L \\leq 1000000000$\n\n$1\\leq M < N \\leq 100000$\n\n$1\\leq Q \\leq 100000$\n\n###Subtasks\n\n### 40 points : \n\n$1\\leq M < N \\leq 1000$\n\n$1\\leq Q \\leq 1000$\n\n### 60 points : \n\n$1\\leq M < N \\leq 100000$\n\n$1\\leq Q \\leq 100000$\n\n###Sample Input:\n5 4 5\n\n1 2 10\n\n1 3 5\n\n2 4 5\n\n2 5 4\n\n4 3\n\n5 3\n\n2 3\n\n1 5\n\n4 5\n\n###Sample Output:\n10\n\n14\n\n10\n\n0\n\n4\n",
