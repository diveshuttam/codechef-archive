Pac-man is having an area of $1$ square units as well and it completely occupies the cell area touching all edges and corners of square where he is currently in. \nHe starts from bottom left corner cell and wants to reach top right corner cell. He can only shift to the immediate right cell or to the immediate top cell in $1$ move. He cannot make more than $k1$ consecutive moves in up direction and more than $k2$ consecutive moves in right direction. You will be given the values of $k1$ and $k2$. \n\nThe rule of the game is simple: each time he reaches the destination cell, he is awarded $1$ gem and the game restarts and he is placed in the bottom left corner. For **each unique path** he takes to reach the destination he is awarded $1$ gem. Finding the total number of gems that he can get is not a very difficult task and our hero wasn't interested. So, now the ghosts are back with something new.\n \nThere are no moving ghosts in the game since this is the static version. Instead, they have placed **jammers** at $m$ places. A jammer is a point sized device which can be placed on the intersection of a horizontal and vertical wire. Every jammer will emit rays in direction of other $m-1$ jammers i.e. rays will be present on the line segment joining any two wires. Our hero dies as soon as he touches any ray or a jammer itself and the game restarts placing him in the initial cell. \nNow calculate the total score of the game that pac-man can achieve without getting killed. Print the answer modulo $10^9+7$.\n\n\n\n\n###Input:\n- First line contains $N$ - the size of the matrix area and $k1, \n k2$ as described above.\n\n- Second line contains $m$ - the number of jammers.\n\n- Next $m$ lines contain two int two integers each $x, y$ denoting coordinates of the jammers.\n\n\n\n###Output:\nPrint the total score that Pac-man can achieve modulo $10^9+7$.\n\n\n###Constraints:\n- $3 \\leq N \\leq  400$\n\n- $1 \\leq k1, k2 \\leq N$\n\n- $1 \\leq m \\leq N*N-1$\n\n\n\n###Subtask $1$ (20 points):\n$m \\leq 15$\n\n###Subtask $2$ (80 points):\nOriginal constraints\n\n\n\n###Sample Input:\n6 5 6\n\n4\n\n4 4\n\n4 5\n\n5 3\n\n2 4\n\n###Sample Output:\n$1$\n\n\n###Explanation:\nRefer to this [image] (https://drive.google.com/file/d/10VJIp9R9Ml2WPxRQ53nfxP-9lef2AUzt/view?usp=sharing) for better understanding of the sample input.\n\nThe only path left is marked by red arrows. So total gems that pac-man can get is $1$",
