There is a dockyard from where Luffy starts his voyage and $n$ number of islands which are aligned collinearly. The dockyard can be considered to be pinned at $0$ and other islands are at some distance from it. **No two islands share the same location.** \n\nLuffy will stop at each island consecutively starting with the one closest to the dockyard and rest for a week. While he rests, helper ships will be sent to the untraveled islands as reinforcements and supplies by him. Now, each town has some size which is the population of that island and whenever he is at island $x$, he will help all the islands that are smaller than $x$ and yet to be traveled. For any ship that he sends, some cost needs to be paid which is the distance traveled by that ship (distance between islands where it starts and stops). \n\nHe is not king of pirates yet and he is limited on resources and so he chooses a **size-difference factor $(d)$** which would mean that he'll send ships only on those islands which have size difference greater than or equal to $d$ with the island Luffy is currently on. The size-difference factor will remain same throughout his journey. Note that the helper ships will be sent to each island satisfying the criteria and the value of $d$ can only be a **non-negative integer.**\n\nNami suggests him to **not spend more than $B$** amount of money in the journey. However, Luffy wants to help as many people as he can and as many times but he is unable to choose the optimal value of $d$ which is your task to do now.\n\n\n\n###Input:\n- First line contains $n,  B$ as described above.\n\n- Next line contains $n$ integers denoting the size of each island $S_i$\n\n- Next line contains $n$ integers denoting the consecutive locations of islands starting from the one closest to dockyard $x_i$\n\n\n\n###Output:\nPrint one integer denoting the optimal value of $d$. It must be a non-negative integer. \n\n\n\n###Constraints:\n- $2 \\leq n \\leq 10^5 $\n\n- $0 \\leq B \\leq $ 10<sup>18</sup> \n\n- $1 \\leq S_i \\leq 10^6$\n\n- $1 \\leq x_i \\leq 10^6$\n\n- $ x$ <sub>i-1</sub> $< x$ <sub>i</sub>\n\n\n\n###Sample Input:\n5 8\n\n3 2 7 12 4\n\n2 4 6 8 12\n\n\n###Sample Output:\n4\n\n\n###Explanation\nIf value of $d$ is $4$, the islands having locations $2, 4, 6, 12$ will not send any helper ships as there are no islands with respect to each of them that have required size. Hence the total spending is from island with location $8$ and that is $12-8 = 4$ < $B$\n\nTaking any lesser value of $d$ will result in more than $8$ units of spending",
