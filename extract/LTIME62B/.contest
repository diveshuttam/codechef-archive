At CodeChef, we work hard to revive the geek in you by hosting a programming contest at the start of the month and another smaller programming challenge in the middle of the month.</p>\r\n<h4>About CodeChef July Lunchtime 2018:</h4>\r\n<p class=\"last\">CodeChef Lunchtime is a three hours coding contest where you can show off your computer programming skills.</p>\r\n<h4>Contest Details:</h4>\r\n<ul class=\"last\">\r\n<li><strong>Duration: </strong> 3 hours</li>\r\n<li><strong>Start Date: </strong> Saturday, 28th July, 2018 at 19:30 HRS (IST)</li>\r\n<li><strong>End Date: </strong> Saturday, 28th July, 2018\u00a0at 22:30 HRS (IST)</li>\r\n<li>Check your timezone <a href=\"https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=July+Lunchtime+2018&amp;iso=20180728T1930&amp;p1=44&amp;ah=3\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>Eligibility Criteria: Anyone with a knack for Programming :P</h4>\r\n<p class=\"last\">Our contests are open to all the programmers across the globe.</p>\r\n<h4>What's in it for you?</h4>\r\n<p>The idea behind these programming contests is that we want you to learn while competing. Also we believe that it is alright to refer to tutorials, books and other materials, learn a concept and then apply the same to solve a problem during a contest. But it is <strong>not alright to copy other people's solutions or seek other people's help to solve a problem without understanding it.</strong> The dividing line may seem to be thin but it can be captured by the spirit of learning. If whatever you are doing is making you learn while you do so, we tend to believe that it is alright. However, all the participants are expected to abide to <a class=\"button blue\" href=\"http://discuss.codechef.com/questions/18662/does-codechef-have-any-code-of-conduct\">CodeChef Code Of Conduct</a></p>\r\n<p>Not just that, as a token of motivation we also give away goodies to the winners of the contest. You can know more about prizes <a href=\"http://discuss.codechef.com/questions/51999/how-do-i-win-a-codechef-goodie\">here</a>. However, our sole intention lies in making our users learn new concepts while competing.</p>\r\n<p><strong>For Indians:</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Top 5 school students from ranklist will receive 50 laddus &amp; a certificate.
