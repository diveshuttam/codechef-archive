The N (1 <= N <= 25000) towers are conveniently numbered 1..N; tower i has height M_i (1 <= M_i <= 100000).</p>\n<p>\nHe wishes to modify the towers in the following fashion:\nHe has a list of numbers B_1 through B_N (1 <= B_i <= 100000), and wants to change the tower heights to those heights B_1, ..., B_N in some order (not necessarily the order given or any other order derived from the data).</p>\n<p>\nHis strength is obviously, limited. It takes Majin a total X (1 <= X <= 100) effort per unit height added and Y (1 <= Y <= 100) effort per unit height\nreduced.</p>\n<p>\nMajin would like to know the minimum possible total effort of modifying his towers if he picks the best permutation of heights. The answer\nis guaranteed to fit within a 32-bit signed integer.\n</p>\n\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>\nThe first line has an integer 't' (1<=t<=10), the number of test cases. t cases follow.\n\nEach test case begins with three space-separated integers on a single line: N, X, and Y. N lines follow, each with integers M_i and B_i.\n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>\nA single integer, the minimum total effort needed to rebuild the towers, for each test case, one per line.\n\n<h3>Example</h3>\n\n<pre>\n<b>Input:</b>\n1\n3 6 5\n3 1\n1 2\n1 2\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n11\n</pre>\n<b>Explanation</b>\n<p>\nMajin's towers have heights 3, 1, and 1. He would like to change them so that their heights are 1, 2, and 2, in some order.\nIt takes 6 units of effort to add a unit of height and 5 to remove a unit of height.\n<p>\nMajin reduces the first tower's height by 1, for an effort of 5 (yielding towers of heights 2, 1, and 1).\nHe then adds one unit of height to the second tower for an effort of 6 (yielding towers of heights 2, 2, and 1).\n\n\n",
