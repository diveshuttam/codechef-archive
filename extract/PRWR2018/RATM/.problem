You are staying in an area where a lot of people are robbed and mugged when trying to withdraw money. With this in mind, Reziba plans to include a safety feature, where if the user inputs the reverse of his pin, the police is immediately informed and comes to the rescue (Though they couldn't find Harshit's 5T).<br>\nBut even though this was implemented by Reziba, some users still continued to get robbed.\n<br><br>\nGiven a pin P of length N to a user, find out if the user is safe or not.\n</p>\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The first line of the input contains an integer <b>T</b> denoting the number of test cases. The description of <b>T</b> test cases follows.</li>\n<li>The first line of each test case contains a single integer <b>N</b> denoting the length of the pin</li><li>The second line contains the pin <b>P</b> of length N</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>For each test case, output a single line containing \"Yes\" without quotes,if the pin is safe, otherwise print \"No\" if not safe.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>T</b> \u2264 <b>500</b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>N</b> \u2264 <b>100000</b></li>\n<li><b>P</b> contains digits from 0-9</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n2\n2\n54\n3\n111\n<b>Output:</b>\nYes\nNo\n</pre>",
