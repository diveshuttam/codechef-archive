There are <b>P(<=N-2)</b> police stations in the city, maximum 1 police station per node.\n<br><br>\nHe wants to get from node <b>S</b> to node <b>F</b> as soon as possible, but also he definitely wants to visit a police station before he reaches and stops at <b>F</b>. He does not have a lot of stamina, and wants to reach a police station that is within distance <b>D</b> (Distance from <b>S</b> to <b>P</b>) before running out of stamina. Once he reaches a police station, he reports the complaint and regenerates enough stamina to go home. He also wants to minimise the distance, so he always chooses the shortest path.\n<br><br>\nGiven that the city is in form of a connected graph, output the minimum distance Harshit needs to travel from <b>S</b> to a police station, then from this police station to <b>F</b>, print sum of these 2 distances (Total distance is to be minimised).\n<br><br>\nIt is compulsory to visit a police station.\n<br><br>\nIf Harshit runs out of stamina before reaching a police station, output -1.\n</p>\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The first line of the input contains an integer <b>T</b> denoting the number of test cases. The description of <b>T</b> test cases follows.</li>\n<li>The first line of each test case contains five space seperated integers <b>N, D, P, S, F</b></li><li>The second line contains<b>P</b> space seperated nodes denoting the nodes that are police stations.</li>\n<li>The next <b>N-1</b> lines contain 3 space seperated integers <b>U, V</b> and <b>d</b> denoting an undirected edge between <b>U</b> and <b>V</b> of distance <b>d</b></li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>For each test case, output the minimum distance required to reach from <b>S</b> to <b>F</b> such that you always pass through a police stations. Output <b>-1</b> if not possible.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>T</b> \u2264 <b>15</b></li>\n<li><b>3</b> \u2264 <b>N</b> \u2264 <b>10^5</b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>D, d</b> \u2264 <b>10^12</b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>S, F, U, V</b> \u2264 <b>N</b></li>\n<li><b>S</b> and <b>F</b> can never be a police station</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n1\n5 100 2 1 5\n3 4\n1 2 2\n1 3 1\n1 4 5\n3 5 2\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n3\n</pre>\n<p></p>\n<p><b>Explanation</b><br>The shortest route taken by Harshit is from node 1 to police station node 3 (distance 1), and from node 3 to to final node 5 (distance 2), hence total distance is 3.\n</p>",
