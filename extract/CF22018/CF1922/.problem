In his mission he needs $special$ bullets to knock his enemies down. As he is busy clearing the path for his friends, he wants your help to find how many $special$ bullets he has.    \n    \nYou are given a series of $N$ integers which represents powers of bullets. You need to find the number of $special$ bullets.    \n\nA bullet is said to be $special$ if its power is $greater$ than and $divisible$ by powers of all of its $adjacent$ bullets.   \n\n###Input:\n\n- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases.     \n- The description of $T$ test cases follows.    \n- The first line of each test case contains a single integer $N$.    \n- The second line of each test case contains series of $N$ space-separated integers.    \n    \n###Output:    \nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \u2014 the number of $special$ bullets.\n\n###Constraints \n- $1 \\leq T \\leq 10$    \n- $2 \\leq N \\leq 10^5$        \n- Series contains non-negative integers $ \\leq 10^9$\n\n###Sample Input:\n2     \n5    \n2 4 2 8 4    \n6    \n6 2 4 1 8 3\n\n###Sample Output:\n2    \n2\n\n###EXPLANATION:\nTest Case 1 :   \n      \nBullet with power 4 is special because 4 is greater than and divisible by 2.        \nBullet with power 8 is special because 2 and 4 are less than 8 and 8 is divisible by 2 and 4.    \n    \nTest Case 2 :    \n    \nBullet with power 6 is special because 2 is less than 6 and 6 is divisible by 2.     \nBullet with power 4 is special because 2 and 1 are less than 4 and 4 is divisible by 2 and 1.    \n              Bullet with power 8 is not special because it is not divisible by 3.",
