In the event the participants were asked to make their robot collect as many balls as possible. In the event the team were asked to design a robot which would move in one line and collect balls from the bucket, the buckets were arranged in one row. The left margin is drawn to the left of the leftmost bucket and a right margin is drawn to the right of the rightmost bucket. No robot should cross the margins before completing their collection or else they would not be allowed further to collect the balls. The robots used in the contest can hold infinite number of balls. As soon as the bucket becomes empty the robot kicks it out and the space becomes vacant. All the robots where remote controlled. Initially the robot starts from the leftmost bucket.</p>\n<p>Now you are given the sequence <b>S</b> of commands for different teams, you have to print the number of balls remaining in buckets which are still not kicked out by the robot. The sequence consist of three commands,</p>\n<p>'<b>L</b>' \u2013 turn towards left</p>\n<p>'<b>R</b>' \u2013 turn towards right</p>\n<p>'<b>P</b>' \u2013 move to the next bucket in the current direction and pick a ball</p>\n<p><b>Note:</b> If there is a command \u2018<b>P</b>\u2019 and the direction is towards left but there is no more bucket to the left of the current bucket then the game ends for that team, similar for the case in right direction.</p>\n<p>\n<h3><b>Input</b></h3>\n</p>\n<p>The first line of the input contains an integer <b>T</b>, denoting the number of test cases. The description of <b>T</b> test cases follows.</p>\n<p>The first line of each test case will start with <b>N</b>, number of buckets in the arena. Then in the next line <b>N</b> space separated integers denoting the number of balls in buckets from left to right.</p>\n<p>It is guaranteed that every bucket has at least one ball initially.</p>\n<p>Then in the next line we have the command sequence performed by the team.</p>\n<p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n</p>\n<p>Print the number of balls in all the buckets from left to right in one line separated by a single space, excluding the buckets kicked out. If all the buckets were kicked out by the robot then print only \u2018<b>0</b>\u2019 (quotes for clarity).</p>\n<p>\n<h3><b>Constraints</b></h3>\n</p>\n<p><b>1 \u2264 T \u2264 100</b></p>\n<p><b>1 \u2264 N \u2264 100</b></p>\n<p><b>1 \u2264 |S| \u2264 1000</b></p>\n<p>\n<h3><b>Example</b></h3>\n</p>\n<p><b>Input:</b></p>\n<p>1</p>\n<p>4</p>\n<p>4 4 4 4</p>\n<p>RPPPRPLPPPPPRPPPP</p>\n<p><b>Output:</b></p>\n<p>4 3 3 3</p>\n<p>\n<h3><b>Explanation</b></h3>\n</p>\n<p>Initially the robot is at the leftmost bucket turns towards right then collects balls from the next three bucket remains right turned and then again tries to pick a ball from the next bucket but in doing so goes out of the right margin hence the contest ends.</p>\n",
