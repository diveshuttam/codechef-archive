He can colour each sketch in any colour possible. Obviously he wants to add variety to the sketches, by making a deep contrast between them. So he decides to colour them making sure that no two adjacent sketches are of same colour as well as 1st and last sketch do not have same colour, 2nd and 2nd last do not have same colour , 3rd and 3rd last and so on.</p>\n<p>Find out the number of ways in which he can colour all the sketches. Each way is different in which different colour is used for that sketch.</p>\n<p>As the answer can be very large , find it modulo <b>1000000007</b>.</p>\n<p>\n<h3><b>Input</b></h3>\n</p>\n<p>The first line is <b>T</b>, which is the number of test cases.<br />\nEach test case consists of <b>N</b> and <b>K</b> which is number of sketches and colours.</p>\n<p>\n<h3><b>Output</b></h3>\n</p>\n<p>For each test case, find out the number of ways possible mod <b>1000000007</b>.</p>\n<p>\n<h3><b>Constraints:</b></h3>\n</p>\n<p><b>1 \u2264 T \u2264 100000</b></p>\n<p><b>1 \u2264 N,K \u2264 10^5</b></p>\n<p>\n<h3><b>Example</b></h3>\n</p>\n<p><b>Input:</b></p>\n<p>2</p>\n<p>2 2</p>\n<p>3 2</p>\n<p><b>Output:</b></p>\n<p>2</p>\n<p>0</p>\n",
