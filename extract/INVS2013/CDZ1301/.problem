Both of them have a string of length N consisting of lower case characters only. \u00a0</p>\n<p>A permutation of \u201cabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\u201d is given in the input that defines the POWER of the characters (a-z). The position of the character starting from the left defines the POWER of a character. The position of the leftmost character is taken to be 0.</p>\n<p>If a character is common to both the strings, it is destroyed. The powers of the leftout characters of each of the strings are added separately.  If a character is repeated, then power of only one such character is added. Person with the string of HIGHER POWER wins. \u00a0</p>\n<p>ALICE and BOB want to check if you are smart enough to declare the winner in advance!!<br />\nAre you ready? ;)\n</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The first line of the input contains an integer T, denoting the length of the conversation, and the string M, denoting a permutation of the string \"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\" which defines the power of characters. T and M are separated by exactly one space.<br />\nThe description of T test cases follows.<br />\nIn each of the test cases, FIRST line contains ALICE\u2019s string and SECOND line contains BOB\u2019s string.\n</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>For each query, output on a separate line the winner of the game as \u201cALICE\u201d or \u201cBOB\u201d and \u201cTIE\u201d in case of a tie.<br />\nQuotes for clarity only.<br />\n.</p>\n<ul>\n</ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>T</b> \u2264 <b>30000</b></li>\n<li>SIze of each string &lt;= 100 </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n3\nwmbqkhasuftlcnerdzoxviypjg\njack\njill\ndwarka\nmoksha\numytissv\nhlovhsny\n\n<b>Output:</b>\nBOB\nALICE\nTIE\n</pre><p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p><b>Example case 1.</b> In the first case both the 'j' are cancelled out then the strength of alice's<br />\nstring is (6+12+4) 22 and for bob's string is (21+11) 32 therefore BOB is the answer.\n</p>\n<p><b>Example case 2.</b>In the second test case one 'a' and 'k' are cancelled out the strength of alice's string is (6+16+15+0) 37 and for bob's string is (5+1+18+7) 31 therefore ALICE is the answer.\n</p>\n<p><br /><br />\nNOTE :<b> Use fast Input Output. </b></p>\n",
