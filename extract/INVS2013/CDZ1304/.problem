T test cases follow.For each test case input will just be a number which denotes the team score N.</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>Output should be number of combinations of 1-pointers, 2-pointers and 3-pointers that can lead to the given team score modulo <b>100001</b>.</p>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>T</b> \u2264 <b>100</b></li>\n<li><b>0</b> \u2264 <b>N</b> &lt; <b>10^8</b></li>\n<p><br /><br />\nSum of all the N's across a test file doesn't exceed 10^8.<br />\n<br /></p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n4\n8\n12\n1033\n894755\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n10\n19\n89441\n22727\n</pre><p>\u00a0</p>\n<h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p><b>Example case 1:</b><br />For the 1st test case,following are the possible combinations for team score of 8<br /><br />\n1x8<br /><br />\n1x6 + 2x1<br /><br />\n1x4 + 2x2<br /><br />\n1x2 + 2x3<br /><br />\n2x4<br /><br />\n1x5 + 3x1<br /><br />\n1x3 + 2x1 + 3x1<br /><br />\n1x1 + 2x2 + 3x1<br /><br />\n1x2 + 3x2<br /><br />\n2x1 + 3x2 </p>\n<p><br /><br />\nNOTE :<b> Use fast Input Output. </b></p>\n",
