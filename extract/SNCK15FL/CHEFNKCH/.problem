This kitchen is huge! It is rectangular in shape with dimensions <b>W</b> \u00d7 <b>H</b>, where <b>W</b> is the width and <b>H</b> is the height, both in meters. The kitchen is divided into a grid with <b>W * H</b> individual cells, each of size (<b>1</b> meter) \u00d7 (<b>1</b> meter), and each cell is identified by two integers <b>(x, y)</b> denoting the column and row number of the cell, respectively (<b>1</b> \u2264 <b>x</b> \u2264 <b>W</b> and <b>1</b> \u2264 <b>y</b> \u2264 <b>H</b>).</p>\n<p>Chef has recently become lazy so instead of walking through his kitchen to work, he just sits forever at his chair located at (<b>x<sub>C</sub></b>, <b>y<sub>C</sub></b>). However, he sometimes needs to inspect individual locations (for example, to check if his personnel have become lazy too!). Instead of walking towards that location, he just uses a bunch of cheap robots with cameras. These robots are so cheap that Chef has an infinitely many number of them. However, their cheap parts pose a few severe limitations:</p>\n<p>\n<ul>\n<li>Each robot can only move forward towards the direction it faces, and can only face a direction parallel to one of the walls of the rectangular kitchen.</li>\n<li>Each robot can only turn at 90 degree angles.</li>\n<li>Each robot can only turn at most once.</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n<p>Note that a robot starts at Chef's location.</p>\n<p>There is no problem initially in all of this, because all cells are reachable from Chef's location <b>(x<sub>C</sub>, y<sub>C</sub>)</b>. However, when the appliances arrive and are installed in the kitchen, some cells cease to be reachable with a robot (because cheap robots cannot pass through appliances!).</p>\n<p>Initially, the kitchen is empty, except for his chair. There are <b>N</b> appliances to be installed. Each appliance has dimensions (<b>1</b> meter) \u00d7 (<b>1</b> meter) and occupies exactly one cell. The <b>i</b><sup>th</sup> appliance to be installed in chronological order will be installed in <b>(x<sub>i</sub>, y<sub>i</sub>)</b>. Now, after the addition of each appliance, Chef wants to know how many cells are still reachable with a robot!</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The first line of the input contains five integers <b>W</b>, <b>H</b>, <b>x<sub>C</sub></b>, <b>y<sub>C</sub></b>, <b>N</b> separated by spaces, denoting the dimensions of Chef's new kitchen <b>W</b> \u00d7 <b>H</b>, the location of Chef's chair <b>(x<sub>C</sub>, y<sub>C</sub>)</b>, and number of appliances to add.</p>\n<p>The next <b>N</b> lines contain information about the appliances. The <b>i</b><sup>th</sup> line (after the first line) contains two integers <b>x<sub>i</sub></b> and <b>y<sub>i</sub></b>, where <b>(x<sub>i</sub>, y<sub>i</sub>)</b> is the location of the <b>i</b>th appliance.</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>Output <b>N</b> lines, where the <b>i</b>th line contains the number of reachable locations after adding the first <b>i</b> appliances.</p>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>N</b> \u2264 <b>10<sup>5</sup></b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>W</b>, <b>H</b> \u2264 <b>10<sup>5</sup></b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>x<sub>C</sub></b>, <b>x<sub>i</sub></b> \u2264 <b>W</b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> \u2264 <b>y<sub>C</sub></b>, <b>y<sub>i</sub></b> \u2264 <b>H</b></li>\n<li>No two appliances occupy the same position, and no appliance occupies Chef's position.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n<code>20 10 4 3 5\n6 5\n7 4\n8 4\n9 3\n4 2\n</code>\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n<code>199\n197\n195\n159\n133\n</code>\n</pre><h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p>The following image illustrates the states of the kitchen after all appliances have been added.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/download/extimages/3b77d4fd824beef75b051b97604fb9c9.jpg\" /></p>\n",
