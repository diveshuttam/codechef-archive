    "body": "<p>It was a lovely evening in Morocco so Sundar decided to take his girlfriend out for a ride in his new car. They started from his house and decided to go to the outskirts of the city. The only problem was that his car was a sports car and so it had very low mileage. In order to overcome this he decides to refill his tank in the petrol bunks that are present along his route. He doesn't want to get embarrassed in front of his girlfriend, so he takes just enough money that he needs to pay at the petrol bunks such that he can reach his destination. He is travelling from the point (0, 0) to the point (L, 0) along the x-axis. There are n petrol bunks along the path at positions given by <b>X</b><sub>i</sub> such that 0 &lt; <b>X</b><sub>i</sub> &lt; <b>L</b>. To refill at the <b>i</b><sup>th</sup> station he has to pay a cost <b>C</b><sub>i</sub>. He can only refill his tank fully at each station. His car has a mileage of <b>D</b>, meaning it can cover a distance <b>D</b> after completely refilling, after which it becomes empty. You need to print the minimum money that Sundar would have taken with himself for the ride. Initially assume he has a full tank.</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>The first line of the input contains an integer <b>T</b> denoting the number of test cases.</p>\n<p>The first line corresponding to each test case contains three integers <b>N</b>, <b>L</b> and <b>D</b> denoting the number of petrol bunks, the distance he needs to travel to reach his destination and the mileage of Sundar's car.</p>\n<p>The next <b>N</b> lines contains two integers each, <b>i</b><sup>th</sup> line contains <b>X</b><sub>i</sub> and <b>C</b><sub>i</sub>.</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>For each test case print \"NO\" if it is impossible to reach the destination.</p>\n<p>If it is possible print \"YES\" and print the minimum amount Sundar would have taken with him for the ride, both in the same line separated by a space.</p>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b>1</b> &le; <b>T</b> &le; <b>10</b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> &le; <b>N</b> &le; <b>10<sup>5</sup></b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> &le; <b>L</b> &le; <b>10<sup>9</sup></b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> &le; <b>D</b> &le; <b>10<sup>9</sup></b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> &le; <b>X</b><sub>i</sub> &lt; <b>L</b></li>\n<li><b>1</b> &le; <b>C</b><sub>i</sub> &le; <b>10<sup>4</sup></b></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre>\n<b>Input:</b>\n\n2\n7 20 5\n2 5\n3 6\n7 2\n10 4\n12 3\n16 2\n19 1\n4 8 3\n2 4\n1 2\n4 5\n3 2\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n\nYES 12\nNO\n</pre><h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p>In the first case Sundar can refuel his car at petrol bunk's present at positions 2, 7, 12, 16 and reach the destination at position 20. Hence the cost of refuelling is 5 + 2 + 3 + 2 = 12. Note that the distance between any two consecutive petrol bunks is not more than the mileage of the Sundar's car.</p>\n<p>In the second case, the farthest petrol bunk from starting point is present at position <b>X</b><sub>i</sub> = 4, if he refuels at this petrol bunk, he can only go till <b>X</b> = 4 + 3 = 7. But his destination is at <b>X</b> = 8, hence it is impossible for Sundar to reach his destination.</p>\n",
