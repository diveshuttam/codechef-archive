For you may be surprised by what our chief chef Noodle has in mind for this season! Today, Noodle announced one of his most extra-ordinary ideas ever - <b>Project Spoon</b>. <br/></br/></p>\n<p> Noodle plans to deploy large spoons in the atmosphere so that people all around the world can download food directly from his kitchen thereby saving him a lot of overhead cost. Yes, you read that right. Large spoons suspended in the atmosphere. </p>\n<p> Noodle decides the following strategy to implement his idea. He will deploy exactly <b>N</b> spoons in the country. Every spoon can cater to as many cities as it wants. The only catch is that between every pair of  spoons <b>A</b> and <b>B</b>,  <b>A</b> must cater to at-least one city that <b>B</b> doesn't cater to, and <b> B </b> must cater to at-least one city that <b>A</b> doesn't cater to. </p>\n<p> Noodle would like to know what is the minimum number of cities a country must have for his strategy to be successful. Since, he is not all that good with calculation, he asks you to help him with it. </p>\n\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p> The first line contains an integer <b>T</b> denoting the number of test cases. Each of the next <b>T</b> lines contain an integer <b>N</b>, the number of spoons that Noodle plans to deploy in the country.</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p> For every test case, print in a single line the number of minimum cities required.</p>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><b> 1 </b>\u2264  <b>T</b> \u2264 <b>  100000 </b></li>\n<li><b> 2 </b> \u2264 <b>N</b>  \u2264 <b> 10<sup>18</sup> </b></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre><b>Input:</b>\n2\n2\n3\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n2\n3\n</pre><h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p><b>Example case 1.</b><br/><br />\nEach spoon caters to a different city. Since there are two spoons, two cities are sufficient.\n </br/></p>\n<p><b>Example case 2.</b><br/><br />\nAgain, each spoon needs to cater to one city and there are three spoons. So, three cities are required at minimum.\n</br/></p>\n",
