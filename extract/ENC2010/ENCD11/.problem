    "body": "<p>The Hostel LAN connection is to be laid down. Rooms in the Hostel lie all in a straight line. It is always desired to use minimum number of cable wires for this work and all the rooms receive the LAN service. A room can either get connected to main line or it can get connected to a room to its immediate let or right provided the latter room is already getting the LAN service.\nYou are to write a program that determines the number of different combinations of the cable wires that is possible so that every room receives the service.\n\nexample for 3 rooms:\n<pre>\n \n \tM           M               M\n            / \\         /                      \\\n          1  2      1-2                1-2\n</pre>\nM represent the Main center and 1 and 2 represents the rooms.\nIn first, Main is connected to both.\nIn second, Main is connected to 1 and 1 is connected to 2.\nIn third, Main is connected to 2 and 2 is connected to 1.     \n<h3>Input</h3>\n<p>Each line of input contains a positive integer N (N<=40), the number of rooms.There is only one main supply. A value of 0 for N indicates the end of input which should not be processed.Terminate the input with a zero.\n\n\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>For each line of input you have to output, on a single line, the number of possible arrangements. Output will be less than 2^64 - 1.\n\n\n<h3>Example</h3>\n\n<pre>\n<b>Input:</b>\n1\n2\n3\n0\n\n\n<b>Output:</b>\n1\n3\n8\n</pre>\n",
